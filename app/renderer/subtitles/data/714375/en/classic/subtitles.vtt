2
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.759
No, we're not done yet.

3
00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.093
I need some water.

4
00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:57.724
- Be right back.
- Okay.

5
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.904
Travis?

6
00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.791
Travis.

7
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.615
Travis?

8
00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.550
There you are.

9
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.719
I like the way you think.

10
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.041
This is Ellie.

11
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.172
The opposing council said what?

12
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.217
Well, that's ridiculous.

13
00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:15.862
He infringed on not one
but four of our clients' patents,

14
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.156
and they're filing for validity?

15
00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.825
Are you kidding me?

16
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.827
They may as well cut the check now.

17
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:24.829
Yes.

18
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.540
I understand what you're saying,

19
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.542
but time is of the essence.

20
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.214
Well, I'm actually back in Oceancrest.

21
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.257
Marcus and I are still unpacking.

22
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.593
Yes, it's very exciting.

23
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.888
He's doing well, much better.
Thanks for asking.

24
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.434
Yeah. I think we're all set.
I will be in the office...

25
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:49.604
first thing in the morning,
and we know what to do.

26
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.566
Yes, that sounds perfect.

27
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.861
Okay. Yeah, I'll speak with you
in the morning. Bye-bye.

28
00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.489
Marcus, I'm here.

29
00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.492
Honey?

30
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.663
So much for waiting.

31
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.416
Yeah, sorry. It just showed up
this morning, so I threw it together.

32
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.253
It's not much,
but it's starting to feel like home.

33
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.546
Aw.

34
00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.175
I remember when Brit won this at the fair.

35
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.177
I miss her.

36
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.472
Well, look, Berkeley's only an hour away.

37
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.475
Okay? She'll be home for fall break
before you know it.

38
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:28.393
Yeah.

39
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.272
This is a big lifestyle change, you know.

40
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.985
Do you think it was
a mistake leaving the city?

41
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.655
No, I don't think it was a mistake.
I mean, we came right out of college

42
00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.115
to having Brittany, and...

43
00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:43.908
busy career, so...

44
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.244
it's our time.

45
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.872
-You're stuck with me.
-Stuck with you?

46
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.671
Once, of course,
your case is over, that is.

47
00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.173
Ellie Warren.

48
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.736
Hey!

49
00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.820
Ellie!

50
00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:06.074
I'm so late.

51
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.534
Freeway was a parking lot.

52
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.288
I just figured you guys had
a late night, first night in the house.

53
00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:14.999
Well, the house is new,

54
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.834
but the man is not.

55
00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:19.295
-How about happy hour tonight?
-Can't.

56
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.131
I am dying to get my flirt on,
and I need my wing woman.

57
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.217
-I know, but Marcus is cooking.
-You see,

58
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.427
that is exactly what I need.

59
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.013
So, tomorrow, then?

60
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.432
We'll get drunk and bitch
about our respective firms.

61
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.352
Do you know how crazy
traffic is gonna be on a Friday night?

62
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.272
Yeah, it's gonna be a nightmare.
It's always a nightmare. Get over it.

63
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.650
I won't take no for an answer.

64
00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:41.776
Bye.

65
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.405
Good morning.

66
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.614
Good morning.

67
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.992
This is our lead counsel, Ellie Warren,

68
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.287
who I am hoping
we can all persuade to reconsider

69
00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.582
and stay at the firm after this is closed.

70
00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.002
This is the tech consultant
I was telling you about, David Hammond.

71
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:00.920
Ellie.

72
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.798
David, hi.

73
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.967
-How you doin'?
-I'm good.

74
00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:07.927
You two know each other?

75
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.638
Yeah, we, we actually went
to college together.

76
00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.682
- Yeah.
- It's been a long time?

77
00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.392
It sure has. Twenty years.

78
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.727
You look like it's been 20 minutes.

79
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.229
Well...

80
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:21.524
Okay, as I was telling David,

81
00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.526
our client alleges that

82
00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.445
the patents belonging to Mr. Moore,

83
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.529
the defendant,

84
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.449
infringe on four
of our client's provisionals.

85
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.700
In addition to that,

86
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:34.829
Mr. Moore seems to be in possession
of certain proprietary information

87
00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:38.040
that he could only have gotten
from our client's patent counsel.

88
00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.417
-Ellie, your thoughts?
-Thank you.

89
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.046
It appears that Mr. Moore's nephew
was working as a clerk at that time,

90
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.633
which means he would have had
easy access to confidential information.

91
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.052
You do realize
that any relevant communications

92
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.097
I acquire from the defendant
and his nephew will be inadmissible.

93
00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:58.186
You just find those e-mails
and let me worry about how to handle him.

94
00:07:58.936 --> 00:07:59.896
I'll find them.

95
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.155
They warned me your boss was a shark.

96
00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:11.741
Maybe next time, you should bring a cage.

97
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:14.660
I can't get over how great you look.

98
00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.078
-Thank you.
-Wait, hold on.

99
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:18.122
There.

100
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:19.874
Thanks.

101
00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:23.419
Well, I have another meeting to run to,
but, um, we should catch up.

102
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.087
Yeah, I would like that.

103
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.088
How about tonight?

104
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.758
Actually, tonight,
I would have to take a rain check.

105
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.594
Not gonna make me wait
another 20 years, are you?

106
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.971
Um, no, that, I will not do.

107
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:37.016
Here's my card. Call me anytime.

108
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.227
I'm gonna hold you to that.

109
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.147
-It was really good to see you, Ellie.
-Welcome to the team.

110
00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.501
I'll do some shopping this week.

111
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:06.087
Maybe fire up the grill over the weekend.

112
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.089
Sounds good.

113
00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:12.843
The wine is great.

114
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:13.928
Thank you.

115
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.932
Yeah, you know,
I think this firm is gonna be...

116
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.934
a really good fit for me.

117
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:23.604
They let me take over a project
from another architect, so it'll be...

118
00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.440
good to get back on the horse,
as they say.

119
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.318
Well, that's amazing.

120
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.738
Just make sure you take your time
because you're still in recovery.

121
00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.640
Have a seat.
Your friend's a miracle worker.

122
00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:03.936
Already, he has uncovered
damaging correspondence from Mr. Moore.

123
00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.730
All of that in a day?

124
00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:09.358
Actually, it only took a few hours,
but I wanted to bring it to you in person.

125
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.152
Look at this.

126
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.949
So, do you think they'll settle?

127
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.659
If we play our cards right.

128
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.830
-This calls for celebration.
-Yeah.

129
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:24.915
Drinks tonight?

130
00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.125
I can't.

131
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.668
- Again.
- No,

132
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.421
I promised my girlfriend Courtney
I'd meet her for happy hour.

133
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:32.548
Girls' night. I get it.

134
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:33.924
Yeah, I'm sorry.

135
00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:35.926
But you know what?

136
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.220
-You should actually come with us.
-No, I couldn't impose.

137
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.848
David, you should.
It'll be fine. She will not mind.

138
00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:42.183
-You sure?
-Yes.

139
00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:43.517
Where?

140
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.645
Nolan's. Seven o'clock?

141
00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.188
-It's a date.
-Good.

142
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.314
Nice work today.

143
00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:49.357
-Thank you.
-See ya.

144
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.316
Bye-bye.

145
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.321
Like another?

146
00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.491
Hey, where are you? I'm here.

147
00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:00.284
Okay, look, don't kill me,

148
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.204
but I have to finish this brief
before I leave.

149
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.747
<i>We go to trial next week.</i>

150
00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.374
Courtney, are you serious?

151
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:09.251
I promise I'll make it up to you.

152
00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:12.713
I understand. Um, well,
I guess I'll see you later, then.

153
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.590
All right, see you soon.

154
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.508
Bye.

155
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:16.759
Hey, Ellie.

156
00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.345
David, hey.

157
00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:20.262
Everything okay?

158
00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.264
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

159
00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.351
I have a booth in the back for us.
Um, is your friend...

160
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.478
Courtney, no.
That was actually just her.

161
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:30.314
She's stuck at the office,
and she won't be able to make it.

162
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.527
I guess I have you all to myself then.

163
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.406
- Just a little.
- Okay. Wow.

164
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.075
You're many things, Ellie Brooks,

165
00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.452
but I've never known you to be a woman
who couldn't keep up.

166
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:46.288
It's "Warren."

167
00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:48.874
Right, right. Mrs. Warren.

168
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.167
Yes.

169
00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:52.920
So what's this about Janice saying
you're leaving the firm?

170
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:56.882
So, my husband and I,
we just bought a new house in Oceancrest.

171
00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:01.721
And, as soon as I finish this case,
I'm gonna start my own practice.

172
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:03.180
- Wow.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.140
Living the dream.

174
00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:08.227
It's exciting. And my daughter, she
just started her first year in college,

175
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.521
so it feels like a good time to go.

176
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:14.608
-No way you have a daughter in college.
-I absolutely have a daughter in college.

177
00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:17.820
Wanna see?

178
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.405
There she is.

179
00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.240
Wow.

180
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.284
She's beautiful.

181
00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:24.201
Thank you.

182
00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:25.745
Has your eyes.

183
00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:28.164
Yeah, that's my girl.

184
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.499
So...

185
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.751
So what about you?

186
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.129
Wife? Girlfriend? Children?
What's your story?

187
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:38.048
Divorced, no kids.

188
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.927
Um, I guess we all can't be
as lucky as you are.

189
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.599
Unless there's trouble in paradise?

190
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.519
No trouble.

191
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:52.188
I do.

192
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.692
I do have the perfect life,
the perfect husband, the perfect daughter,

193
00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.611
the perfect home.

194
00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:01.781
But, you know, one day,
you wake up 20 years later,

195
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.784
and you realize
the person sleeping next to you

196
00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.827
feels like a complete stranger.

197
00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.413
I don't know how that happens.

198
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.290
Twenty years is a long time.

199
00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:13.959
But I'm pretty sure
he's still attracted to you.

200
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:16.879
I don't know.

201
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:20.508
But look, I don't wanna dump
all my drama on you.

202
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.718
No. No, we're just catching up.

203
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:23.636
Okay.

204
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.643
Janice?

205
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.229
Marcus.

206
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.314
Mr. Warren.

207
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:36.941
Yes.

208
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:42.988
If you have to leave,
I totally understand.

209
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.494
No.

210
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:50.621
I'm good.

211
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.543
-Another bottle of wine, then.
-Um...

212
00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:58.504
If we stay here drinking,
people are gonna start talking.

213
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.008
Where would you like to go?

214
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:04.051
I don't know.

215
00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:05.135
Twenty years ago?

216
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.314
So, tell me,
how come you and I never dated?

217
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:23.112
Well, probably because you were
too busy dating those other guys.

218
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:29.326
-Maybe I was just waiting for you to ask.
-Maybe I didn't wanna get my heart broken.

219
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.704
Well, maybe we were just preserving
the friendship.

220
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:34.707
I'll drink to that.

221
00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.168
To friendship.

222
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:44.884
You're a bad influence.

223
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.721
But let's say...

224
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:51.348
What if I had asked you out?

225
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:52.558
Would you?

226
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:55.436
Well,

227
00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:59.106
I don't know that I remember
you looking this good back then.

228
00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.652
I got a confession to make.

229
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.570
Please.

230
00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.615
I knew you worked with the firm
before I took the job.

231
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.241
-Really?
-Yeah.

232
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.578
Janice inquired about my services.
I found out you worked there.

233
00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:14.538
I figured it'd be fun for us to catch up,

234
00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.457
work together, you know.

235
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.126
-I hope you don't mind.
-No, no. Not at all.

236
00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:23.172
I gotta tell you,

237
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.050
if things had worked out differently...

238
00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.095
you would never feel
like you're sleeping with a stranger.

239
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.475
If only.

240
00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:39.980
Do you trust me?

241
00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:44.401
No, I don't trust you.

242
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:45.986
Come on.

243
00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:45.796
Ellie...

244
00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:34.386
No.

245
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.263
No, David. I can't.

246
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.892
I can't. I'm sorry. I have to go.

247
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.358
Ellie!

248
00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.069
Ellie.

249
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.487
I gotta go home, David.

250
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.822
To the complete stranger
sleeping in your bed?

251
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.450
-I never should have said that.
-Listen,

252
00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:58.994
you deserve to be with a man
who appreciates you.

253
00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:03.082
I needed tonight,
but that should have never happened.

254
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.127
My car is here. Good night, David.

255
00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:27.583
Hey, babe.

256
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.335
-Didn't hear you come in.
-Hey.

257
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:06.496
Thank you.

258
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:08.332
This is amazing.

259
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.460
It's exactly what I was looking for.

260
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.397
So, David,

261
00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:17.192
as I recall, the last time you were here,
you weren't doing so well.

262
00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:18.235
Yeah, I know, doc.

263
00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:20.946
But the good news is I'm fine now.

264
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.531
- Really?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:23.865
Work is good.

266
00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:26.493
I'm sleeping again, going to the gym.

267
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:30.330
-I've even started seeing someone.
-There it is.

268
00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.249
Yeah. She's a lawyer.

269
00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:33.917
-Is she?
-Yeah.

270
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.921
The thing is, she's just getting out
of a long-term relationship,

271
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:41.425
so we're gonna take things slow.
Give her some space, you know?

272
00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.928
David, do you remember
when you first came to see me

273
00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:46.805
for your court-ordered anger management?

274
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:51.310
You told me
how broken you were over Deborah.

275
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:55.105
Yeah.

276
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.149
Do you still feel that way?

277
00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.904
Why do you keep bringing that up? I...

278
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.532
I told you I was over it now.

279
00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:09.244
Because, after what you've been through,

280
00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:13.457
I don't think anyone would blame you
if you were still having problems.

281
00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:35.771
Hello?

282
00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:38.190
Mom? Dad?

283
00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.078
Wow.

284
00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:02.547
Wow.

285
00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:17.354
There she is.

286
00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.274
Dad, where did you find this?

287
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:24.528
I keep all your old stuff, baby.
Welcome to your new home.

288
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.779
Thank you, Dad.

289
00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:27.697
I've been looking forward
to this fall break.

290
00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:29.282
Aw, we missed you.

291
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:32.035
- Missed you, too.
- We missed you so much.

292
00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.204
So, what do you think?

293
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.707
It's pink.

294
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.918
- She doesn't like it.
- She doesn't.

295
00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:42.045
Well, we can change
whatever you don't like.

296
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.589
We just wanted you to have
something special to walk into.

297
00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:45.549
Aw, thank you.

298
00:23:45.632 --> 00:23:47.551
But wait, did you see
the private beach though?

299
00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:50.762
- 'Cause that might fix everything.
- I think it might. Yeah.

300
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.806
-Come on. Let's go see. Come on.
-Okay, let's go.

301
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.026
Hey, sweetie.

302
00:24:05.318 --> 00:24:06.153
Mom!

303
00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.487
So, what do you think?

304
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.572
You did it.

305
00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:10.657
New job. New house.

306
00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:12.868
Dad's smiling again.

307
00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:14.536
Now I can breathe.

308
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:25.088
Come on, admit it. You miss the city.

309
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.631
I don't know.

310
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:29.009
Mark my words.

311
00:24:29.092 --> 00:24:32.721
You'll get sick of writing wills
for rich old ladies, and you'll be back.

312
00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:35.432
You'll be back. They always come back.

313
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:37.392
-See you later.
-Bye. Mwah.

314
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.810
-Bye.
-Yeah, bye.

315
00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:42.355
One second.

316
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:49.988
Ellie?

317
00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:52.449
David.

318
00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:53.909
-Hey.
-Wow.

319
00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:55.577
I just left a meeting across the street,

320
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.954
and I thought to myself,
she looks like Ellie.

321
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.664
You look great.

322
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:00.749
Thank you.

323
00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:03.168
Look, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

324
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:04.377
About that night,

325
00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:05.712
I apologize.

326
00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:08.882
No, it's... it's totally fine.
You don't need to apologize.

327
00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:12.344
It was late. We both had too much
to drink. It should've never happened.

328
00:25:12.427 --> 00:25:14.763
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought you
might be angry or something.

329
00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:15.972
-You know?
-Why?

330
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.350
Why would I be angry? I'm... I'm fine.

331
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:20.435
Well, you haven't returned my phone calls.

332
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.523
Hold on a minute.

333
00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:25.774
Sorry, sir.

334
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:29.402
How about we grab a coffee and talk?
My treat.

335
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.323
I... I, um...
I actually just had a coffee,

336
00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:35.492
-but thanks.
-Okay, just talk then?

337
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:39.454
I've got an hour before my next meeting,
and I wanna hear all about your new firm.

338
00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:42.874
I can't, David. I am married.

339
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.085
It's not okay.

340
00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:47.754
I said wait a goddamn minute.

341
00:25:47.837 --> 00:25:49.548
Hey, are you moving or not?

342
00:25:58.139 --> 00:25:59.140
I get it.

343
00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:02.060
But things don't have
to be awkward between us.

344
00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:03.770
I just want you to know...

345
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.855
I'm here for you.

346
00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.732
I appreciate that, David.

347
00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:09.693
Take care.

348
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:55.405
Shit!

349
00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:56.489
Hey, baby.

350
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.867
Hi! I didn't even hear you come in.

351
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.704
- What happened? You all right?
- I just cut my finger.

352
00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:04.372
Does it hurt?

353
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.290
A little bit.

354
00:27:06.499 --> 00:27:07.334
Mwah.

355
00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:08.752
How about that? Better?

356
00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:09.711
Maybe.

357
00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:15.884
-That's better.
-That's better.

358
00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.636
Thank you. Wait, wait, you know what?

359
00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:20.138
It's been a really long day.
I think I... I need more.

360
00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.590
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

361
00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:39.592
Hi.

362
00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:40.510
Hi.

363
00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.221
What a nice surprise.

364
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:46.474
Thank you.

365
00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:49.269
You're welcome. Wow!
Looks like you're getting settled.

366
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:51.688
I'm trying. We're almost there.

367
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:53.648
Wow, this looks really good on you.

368
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.900
I've never seen you look
so relaxed at work.

369
00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:59.237
It's amazing how effective
I can be at my job

370
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.531
when there aren't
millions of dollars at stake.

371
00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:03.116
How's that? Sweet enough?

372
00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:04.117
It's okay.

373
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.535
Okay?

374
00:29:05.618 --> 00:29:08.705
Madam, I will have you know that <i>that...</i>

375
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.249
is the nectar of the gods.

376
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.503
What do you say
we take this desk for a spin?

377
00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:19.758
- That's not a bad idea.
- The notary's here.

378
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:22.051
- Sorry.
- To be continued.

379
00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:23.094
To be continued.

380
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.638
I'm so sorry about that, sir.

381
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.099
Honey, don't forget
we have dinner tonight.

382
00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:29.976
Courtney's coming over,
Brittany's on a date,

383
00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.978
so it'll probably just be the three of us.

384
00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:32.979
Steak or salmon?

385
00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:33.897
Salmon.

386
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.814
Done.

387
00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:58.755
-You must be here for my daughter.
-Yeah. Scott, sir.

388
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.258
Marcus Warren, FBI.

389
00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:04.052
Sir?

390
00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.846
Dad, you remember Scott?
We went to high school together.

391
00:30:08.097 --> 00:30:08.932
Hey, Scott.

392
00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:09.891
Hey, Mrs. Warren.

393
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:11.810
-How you doing?
-Good. Thank you.

394
00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:14.312
-Good. Where you guys headed?
-Dinner and a movie.

395
00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:15.230
Nice.

396
00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:16.981
So, be home at 11:00?

397
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.776
Mom, I'm in college.
I'll be home by 12:00.

398
00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:20.819
11:00.

399
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:22.529
How about 12:00?

400
00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:25.740
Have fun, baby.

401
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:26.950
Thanks. Love you.

402
00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:27.909
Love you.

403
00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:29.369
Bye.

404
00:30:29.452 --> 00:30:30.286
Bye.

405
00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:32.664
I don't get a hug?

406
00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.084
See, it's starting already.

407
00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:41.714
Honey, I feel like maybe we
should've ordered in.

408
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:44.968
-I feel like I'm so behind.
-No, no, this is perfect.

409
00:30:45.051 --> 00:30:46.886
Table's set for three. We're good.

410
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:47.804
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

411
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:49.722
Okay.

412
00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.015
-She's here.
-I got it.

413
00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:54.561
Hey, man. Marcus.

414
00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:56.771
- Welcome to our humble abode!
- Wow!

415
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:59.148
Beautiful. I hope you don't mind
the last-minute plus-one.

416
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:02.527
- No! Not at all.
- Hey! You look beautiful.

417
00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:06.406
-How are you doing? You look gorgeous!
-Hi.

418
00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:09.367
Hi, I'm David. Nice to meet you.

419
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:10.785
Ellie.

420
00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:13.663
Before I forget.
I figured white goes with everything.

421
00:31:13.746 --> 00:31:16.332
Yeah, man. Thank you.
I like this guy already.

422
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:18.751
Look at that, babe.

423
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:20.628
-You guys want a tour?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

424
00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:21.963
Yeah, come on. Out here.

425
00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.132
- This is what sold it, so...
- Whoa.

426
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:25.633
...I'll show you that first.

427
00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:34.267
I'll show you
the... main attraction here.

428
00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.019
Watch yourself.

429
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:38.855
Wow.

430
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.279
So, David,
listen, you gotta tell me.

431
00:31:46.362 --> 00:31:47.947
I'm familiar with tech consultant,

432
00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:49.782
but what's your lane?
What's your specialty?

433
00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:51.367
Actually, I'm a hacker.

434
00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:55.371
Babe! He's consulted with some
of the biggest firms in the city.

435
00:31:55.455 --> 00:31:58.875
Yeah, I'm the guy you hire when you need
information that doesn't wanna be found.

436
00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:01.044
Aha! Well, it's legal though, right?

437
00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:02.253
It's "unofficial."

438
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:05.506
I'm surprised
your old firm never hired him.

439
00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:08.801
-Yeah.
-How'd you two meet?

440
00:32:10.053 --> 00:32:11.804
-You wanna tell them, or...
-No, no, you...

441
00:32:11.888 --> 00:32:12.972
-Okay.
-You tell them.

442
00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:16.184
Okay. So, I'm waiting
for the elevator one day,

443
00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:19.479
and up walks this very handsome,

444
00:32:19.562 --> 00:32:22.899
very confident man, and suddenly...

445
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:27.320
it was like everyone else
in the lobby just disappeared.

446
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.280
I think I even heard music.

447
00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:32.241
Yep.

448
00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.244
So I introduced myself and...

449
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:37.830
Yeah, and I was so captivated by her,

450
00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.959
I asked her out for lunch that afternoon.
Here we are.

451
00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.378
Turns out,
he'd just gone through a bad divorce.

452
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:46.214
What happened?

453
00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:48.675
What's there to say?

454
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:52.428
I had the perfect home, perfect wife.

455
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:58.476
One day, you wake up, and it feels like
the person you've been sleeping next to

456
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.603
for 20 years is a complete stranger.

457
00:33:01.896 --> 00:33:02.730
Wow.

458
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:03.940
That's gotta suck.

459
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.358
Yeah.

460
00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:08.277
-Babe, you don't have to talk about it...
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

461
00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:10.405
I mean, what hurt the most was,

462
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.116
no matter how much time
and effort I put in...

463
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.785
she didn't take me seriously.

464
00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:20.873
Well, hey, onward and upward, right?

465
00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:24.419
Another toast.
To new friends and happy relationships.

466
00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:25.878
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

467
00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:27.213
Cheers!

468
00:33:29.882 --> 00:33:31.009
Anyone up for dessert?

469
00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:32.885
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

470
00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:37.849
-Courtney, wanna come with me?
-Yeah.

471
00:33:37.932 --> 00:33:39.809
-No, no, it's okay, baby. I'll get it.
-You sure?

472
00:33:39.892 --> 00:33:41.436
-Yeah.
-Okay.

473
00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:43.479
This guy.

474
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:52.739
Are you crazy?

475
00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:57.160
How dare you show up at my house.

476
00:33:57.243 --> 00:34:00.038
You don't return my calls.
You don't return my texts.

477
00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:03.791
-How else am I supposed to reach you?
-You're not supposed to.

478
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.376
You don't have to worry.

479
00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:06.961
Our secret is safe.

480
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.504
My husband...

481
00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:11.966
My husband is outside.

482
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.177
Do you not see
what I'm willing to do for you?

483
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.845
Don't you touch me.

484
00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:19.348
-This could work.
-I don't know what you think this is,

485
00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:22.143
but I want you to go outside right now

486
00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:26.355
and come up with an excuse
as to why you need to leave early.

487
00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:29.400
And I don't ever wanna see you around me,

488
00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:33.988
my daughter, my husband,
or my home ever again.

489
00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:37.533
Do you understand?

490
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.509
Just got off the phone with a client.

491
00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:58.137
The file I was working with got corrupted,
so, and they need it tonight.

492
00:34:58.471 --> 00:34:59.305
So I gotta go.

493
00:34:59.388 --> 00:35:01.682
Courtney, I can take you home.

494
00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:08.064
No. No, that's okay.
I don't want you to have to drive

495
00:35:08.147 --> 00:35:10.817
all the way back by yourself.
That's... It's fine.

496
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:14.654
-Call me.
-Yeah.

497
00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:18.157
-What's wrong? Everything okay?
-No, I'm fine.

498
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.920
<i> Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>Courtney. Leave a message.</i>

499
00:36:14.755 --> 00:36:17.925
Courtney, it's Ellie,
and I need you to call me back.

500
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:21.512
I've left you so many messages.
I need to talk to you.

501
00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.639
Hey, Mom. What's this?

502
00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:26.017
- Call me back.
! "Forget Me Nots."

503
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.311
I remember this song.

504
00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:29.562
Where did you get this?

505
00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:33.441
I actually found it
in a box in the garage.

506
00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:37.069
This could be worth some real money.
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

507
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.322
-I'll keep it.
-Okay.

508
00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:50.875
-Hey.
-Don't!

509
00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:00.718
I know you're upset.

510
00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:04.847
You seduce my friend?
You show up at my house?

511
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:06.807
You've crossed the line, David.

512
00:37:07.975 --> 00:37:09.644
I get it. I get it.

513
00:37:11.687 --> 00:37:12.855
You wanna be discreet.

514
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:17.777
-No one has to know about us.
-Us? There is no us!

515
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.153
Would your husband think that?

516
00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:21.322
If you even think
about calling my husband...

517
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.491
I'm not saying that I would, but I could.

518
00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:28.371
Come on, Ellie.

519
00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:32.458
Tell me that night didn't unlock
something inside of you.

520
00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:34.210
I mean, look at you.

521
00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:36.170
We did it!

522
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:42.385
You know what? I've tried
to be considerate of your feelings

523
00:37:42.468 --> 00:37:44.345
and respectful of our friendship,

524
00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:46.347
but what is it gonna take?

525
00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:50.184
-For what?
-For you to stay away from me,

526
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.270
my family, and Courtney.

527
00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.940
And make the same mistake
we made 20 years ago?

528
00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:57.525
David, the only mistake I made

529
00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.777
was getting caught up
in the moment that night.

530
00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.906
I am warning you, David.
You've gotta stay the hell...

531
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.866
Who do you think
you're talking to, Deborah?

532
00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:09.829
Who the hell is Deborah?

533
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.416
David?

534
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:15.626
David.

535
00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:19.797
Look.

536
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:21.424
Okay, listen.

537
00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:26.053
I know that we have had
some amazing memories in the past,

538
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.056
and I am just asking you to please...

539
00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:32.727
let's leave the past

540
00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:34.353
where it is.

541
00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.939
This has got to stop.

542
00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:40.818
I need you to leave me alone.

543
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:34.205
Hey.

544
00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:36.415
Hey.

545
00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:39.251
What's wrong?

546
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:04.819
He told me everything on the way home.

547
00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:07.113
So you basically just let me
sit through that whole dinner

548
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:08.614
and make a fool out of myself.

549
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:11.992
Courtney, that is not true.
I tried to tell you.

550
00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.077
Tell me what?

551
00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:16.372
David is unstable.

552
00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:17.998
He's unstable?

553
00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:20.751
You come on to him
in the middle of a nightclub,

554
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:23.546
rip his clothes off in the bathroom,
but he's unstable?

555
00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:26.173
You then invite him to lunch,

556
00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:28.634
scream at him
in front of the entire restaurant,

557
00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:30.302
-but he's unstable?
-No, wait. I'm sorry.

558
00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.889
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What exactly did he tell you?

559
00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:35.182
The truth.

560
00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:38.853
How you wanted to have an affair
ever since Janice hired him,

561
00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:40.104
but he turned you down.

562
00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:42.565
How you've been trying to seduce him...

563
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:45.943
ever since you found out I was seeing him.

564
00:40:46.026 --> 00:40:47.778
No, that is not true.

565
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:51.365
You know me better than anyone.
I would never do that to you.

566
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.409
Really? You wouldn't do that to me?

567
00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:54.869
Explain that.

568
00:40:58.581 --> 00:40:59.874
Wait a minute, no.

569
00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:03.210
He sent these messages to me.

570
00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:07.673
He must have just switched the names.
I didn't do that.

571
00:41:08.507 --> 00:41:10.759
You know,
he didn't even wanna show them to me

572
00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:14.054
because he knows what these would do
to your marriage if they ever got out.

573
00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.306
And you believe him.

574
00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:18.100
You actually believe the guy...

575
00:41:18.934 --> 00:41:23.105
who sat with us at dinner
and told us both that he was a hacker.

576
00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:27.860
If he wanted you to know so badly
that he and I were having an affair,

577
00:41:27.943 --> 00:41:30.070
why do you think
he waited so long to tell you?

578
00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:33.532
Because apparently, he's the only one
who cares about your marriage.

579
00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:37.286
I really don't know why I bothered
to even come down here.

580
00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:40.289
- Wait.
- My God. I'm... I'm just gonna go.

581
00:41:40.372 --> 00:41:41.332
-Courtney!
-No. No.

582
00:41:41.415 --> 00:41:43.083
Thanks for your complete honesty.

583
00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.753
-Really nice, Ellie. Really nice.
-Wait, Courtney.

584
00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:46.670
Listen to me.

585
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:50.382
Are you telling me, right now,
that you really believe

586
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.259
that there's nothing wrong?

587
00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:55.513
I definitely believe
there's something wrong here.

588
00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:03.145
Courtney, you're being ridiculous.
I would not lie to you.

589
00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:04.813
Courtney.

590
00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:06.524
Courtney!

591
00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:41.141
Linda, if anyone calls,
I'm heading into the city for a few hours.

592
00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.643
Okay.

593
00:42:52.361 --> 00:42:56.156
But I need those papers on my desk
by Friday at 2:00 p.m., Desiree.

594
00:42:57.866 --> 00:42:59.868
- Ellie! Hi!
- Hi.

595
00:43:01.495 --> 00:43:02.329
How are you?

596
00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.456
-It's so good to see you.
-You too.

597
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.624
Professor Nicole.

598
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:07.918
I don't know that I'm ever
gonna be able to get past that.

599
00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:09.628
God. I can't believe
how good you look!

600
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:11.880
What are you, hiding one
of those portraits in the attic?

601
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.841
-What's your secret?
-I left the city.

602
00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.426
Yeah, that'll do it.

603
00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:18.345
Brittany told me about Marcus.
He's getting better?

604
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.681
Yeah, he's doing good. Slowly but surely.

605
00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.808
-Thanks for asking.
-God, it's so funny you call.

606
00:43:22.891 --> 00:43:25.269
I was just going through old photos
for the retrospective.

607
00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:27.229
-Really?
-Yeah. What brings you up this way?

608
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.231
David Hammond.

609
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:31.567
What about him?

610
00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:34.778
A friend of mine is, looking
for a consultant,

611
00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.864
and I knew you were friends.
And I was just wondering

612
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.157
what you thought of him.

613
00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:40.743
I mean, I don't remember much.

614
00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:43.954
Just that he was smart,
kinda quiet though.

615
00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:46.832
Then, of course,
that he was totally obsessed with you.

616
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:48.751
He was?

617
00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:51.503
Yeah, come on. Wait, you didn't notice?

618
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:54.590
No, actually. No.

619
00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:55.841
That's right.

620
00:43:55.924 --> 00:43:58.093
Because you only had eyes for Marcus,

621
00:43:58.177 --> 00:44:00.679
all hot and sweaty
in his Stanford uniform.

622
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:02.306
Well, yeah, that I remember.

623
00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:05.643
But you must remember
David's ex-wife, Deborah, right?

624
00:44:06.852 --> 00:44:09.980
No. I don't... I don't know
that I've... I've met Deborah.

625
00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:12.733
Really? She looked just like you.

626
00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.277
-Really?
-Yeah.

627
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.863
So, why did they get a divorce?

628
00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:23.160
I... I mean, look,
David was a nice guy, you know.

629
00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:24.870
Handsome, accomplished.

630
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:30.751
But off the record...

631
00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:35.172
Deborah told me he had a crazy temper.

632
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:38.634
And he was super controlling
and just crazy jealous.

633
00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:44.890
Wish... I wish I could hear
her side of the story.

634
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.309
Ellie, she's dead.

635
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:48.602
What?

636
00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.729
A couple months after the divorce,

637
00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:52.856
someone broke into
her new boyfriend's place,

638
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.941
killed them both.

639
00:44:54.441 --> 00:44:55.484
My God.

640
00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:00.531
Was David ever considered a suspect?

641
00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:03.575
Yeah, they investigated him,
of course.

642
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:07.538
But, I mean, at the end of the day,
the police decided it was just a robbery.

643
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:10.124
Apparently, the new boyfriend
was a dealer,

644
00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:12.334
had a bunch of cash
lying around the house.

645
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:14.878
Ellie, what's this really about?

646
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.390
My God.

647
00:48:12.681 --> 00:48:15.225
Courtney, hi, it's Ellie.
Please call me when you get this message.

648
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:18.270
I have some information I think
you need to know.

649
00:48:18.353 --> 00:48:20.814
Call me on my cell.
I'll be in the office as well.

650
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:22.983
All right. Bye. Love you.

651
00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:25.903
Come in.

652
00:48:25.986 --> 00:48:27.487
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, sweetie.

653
00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:29.740
You're up early.

654
00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:31.783
- Yeah, Scott's coming over.
- Okay.

655
00:48:34.953 --> 00:48:37.706
-Is everything okay?
-Um, yeah.

656
00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:39.374
You know what?

657
00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:41.418
Give me a hug.

658
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:42.461
Why?

659
00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:44.338
I need it.

660
00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:58.727
- Morning.
- Morning!

661
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.646
- Any messages?
- Your 10:30 confirmed.

662
00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:02.940
Okay. If Courtney calls,
pull me from whatever I'm doing.

663
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:04.191
No problem.

664
00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:06.652
And if this guy shows up, call the police.

665
00:49:07.235 --> 00:49:08.111
Sure.

666
00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.579
So the good news is
I'm finally starting to get

667
00:49:17.663 --> 00:49:20.040
some clients of my own
instead of just proofing.

668
00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.750
That's great, Dad.

669
00:49:21.833 --> 00:49:24.086
Yeah. You remember
that job I did in Palo Alto?

670
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.464
Babe?

671
00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:29.257
Mom?

672
00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:33.470
- You remember the job I did in Palo Alto?
- Yeah.

673
00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:36.056
Well, it turns out
that guy bought some land here

674
00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.266
and wants me to design a building for him.

675
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.025
That's amazing, honey.

676
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.321
Yeah. Looks like things
might be finally turning around.

677
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:12.801
Everything okay, Mom?

678
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.636
Yeah, no. I'm...

679
00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:17.055
I'll get it.

680
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:18.432
No, no. I got it.

681
00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:25.022
-You okay?
-Yeah, no, I'm fine. Um...

682
00:50:26.064 --> 00:50:28.400
I need to call my office. Be right back.

683
00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.531
<i>Hey.</i>

684
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:36.742
How did you get it?

685
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:42.581
Ellie, if I can break into
one of the top e-mail service providers

686
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:43.832
in the country for you,

687
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:46.501
I can definitely hack
into a nightclub for me.

688
00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:49.838
You give me one reason
why I shouldn't call the police

689
00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:51.339
and get a restraining order.

690
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:56.219
Well, I wonder what would happen
if I sent that video to Marcus.

691
00:50:56.303 --> 00:51:00.515
I wonder what would happen if the world
knew what really happened to your ex-wife.

692
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.560
I'm not giving up on us, Ellie.

693
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.354
David?

694
00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:08.899
David.

695
00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:12.944
Shit.

696
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.532
<i> Hi! You've reached</i>
<i>Courtney. Leave a message.</i>

697
00:51:17.616 --> 00:51:19.201
Courtney. It's Ellie.

698
00:51:19.284 --> 00:51:22.788
Please call me as soon as you get
this message. I need to talk to you.

699
00:52:31.231 --> 00:52:32.232
So how was your day?

700
00:52:33.525 --> 00:52:34.359
It was great.

701
00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:42.951
You're so sweet. Babe.

702
00:52:43.618 --> 00:52:44.494
What is it?

703
00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.791
Sexy.

704
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:53.170
Sure you wouldn't rather see me in less?

705
00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:54.504
It's no rush.

706
00:52:56.047 --> 00:52:56.882
Okay.

707
00:52:58.049 --> 00:52:59.718
I guess I'll see you in a minute.

708
00:53:29.497 --> 00:53:30.457
What do you think?

709
00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:37.797
Beautiful.

710
00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:49.684
Tell me you love me.

711
00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:53.188
- You did all this time, tell me.
- I love you.

712
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:55.315
Yeah, I want you.

713
00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:06.660
I'm yours.

714
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:36.815
Don't go.

715
00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:40.360
I'm gonna miss you.

716
00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.029
Yeah.

717
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.115
Promise.

718
00:54:45.657 --> 00:54:47.075
Okay. See you later.

719
00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:48.702
-Call me.
-I will.

720
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:18.440
God.

721
00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:51.848
Hey, David.

722
00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.454
Hey. Hope you
weren't waiting long.

723
00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:16.873
Hey. No, man. Not at all.

724
00:56:17.248 --> 00:56:20.418
Gotta tell you, I was surprised
when I got your call this morning, man.

725
00:56:20.502 --> 00:56:23.213
I never thought I'd get a chance
to play this course. It's amazing.

726
00:56:23.296 --> 00:56:24.589
You're gonna love it.

727
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.225
There it is.

728
00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:36.643
Good one.

729
00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:38.311
Thanks, man.

730
00:56:38.686 --> 00:56:40.063
Tell you, it's the putter.

731
00:56:40.146 --> 00:56:41.689
Thing damn near putts itself.

732
00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.776
Elle got it for me
for my birthday last year.

733
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:47.237
She really seems like a great woman.

734
00:56:48.446 --> 00:56:49.906
I'd love to hear your secret.

735
00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:52.659
Well, I'll tell you.
A marriage counselor once told us

736
00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.828
that you have to approach marriage

737
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.788
as a series of little marriages.

738
00:56:57.455 --> 00:56:58.957
So you two are in counseling?

739
00:56:59.457 --> 00:57:01.459
No, no. Not anymore. We were, but...

740
00:57:01.876 --> 00:57:03.253
that was before I got hurt.

741
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:05.463
Mind if I ask what happened?

742
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:09.467
No, no. Not at all.
I was riding my bike over Glen Canyon,

743
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:10.760
like I do every morning.

744
00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:13.513
I must have veered off the road
or something, I'm not really sure,

745
00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.348
but I never saw or heard the truck.

746
00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:20.228
Week later, I woke up in the hospital,
broken collarbone, couple cracked ribs.

747
00:57:20.895 --> 00:57:22.730
I was in a body cast for six months.

748
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.607
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

749
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:25.900
It was tough at first.

750
00:57:25.984 --> 00:57:26.985
It's getting better.

751
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.447
Everything is.

752
00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:35.827
Work's great.
Things with Ellie are a lot better.

753
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.371
You're a lucky guy.

754
00:57:38.663 --> 00:57:41.040
She's beautiful, successful.

755
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.674
A lot of guys would kill
to have a woman like that.

756
00:57:49.757 --> 00:57:51.509
Thanks, man.

757
00:57:51.593 --> 00:57:52.510
I'm just saying.

758
00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.762
You have no idea what it's like

759
00:57:54.846 --> 00:57:57.432
to see the woman you love
touching another man,

760
00:57:57.849 --> 00:57:58.850
kissing another man,

761
00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:01.102
wondering if she really loves him.

762
00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:03.813
What you might do
if you got that man alone.

763
00:58:07.233 --> 00:58:10.361
Hey, man.
Sorry to hear about your wife, too.

764
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:12.280
Ex. Ex-wife.

765
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:14.115
Yeah, well, either way.

766
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.703
Hey, there.

767
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:20.163
How you doing?

768
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.420
It was, man. It was good stuff, man.
I appreciate the call. Let's do it again.

769
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:28.796
-Absolutely. We will.
-All right.

770
00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:19.389
-Hi.
-Hi. How can I help you?

771
00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:21.933
I'm not sure if you remember me
from this morning,

772
00:59:22.016 --> 00:59:24.644
but I'm a friend of, um, David Hammond's.

773
00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:28.898
Um, I left a few things
in his place last night.

774
00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:31.901
So, I was just wondering
if you could let me into his apartment.

775
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:39.951
We've all had those nights.

776
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.740
My God.

777
01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.507
No, no, no.

778
01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.213
Hey, babe.

779
01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.592
Golf was really fun. Yeah.

780
01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:44.844
You on the way home from work?

781
01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:47.805
You want me to pick up some dinner?

782
01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.685
Okay. Headed to you right now.

783
01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:07.033
Answer the phone. Courtney!

784
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:10.995
You've got about ten seconds
until I hang up.

785
01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.623
Courtney, I think David killed his wife.

786
01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.042
That's not even remotely funny.

787
01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.211
Listen to me.
I know you are upset with me.

788
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.463
<i>And you have every right to be.</i>

789
01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:23.299
But David is not the man
that you think he is.

790
01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:25.843
Everything from getting
the job at the firm

791
01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.763
to dating you has all been to get to me.

792
01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:30.556
And you know this how?

793
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.475
Because I went to his apartment.

794
01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.477
He had pictures of me on his computer.

795
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.728
<i>He's been watching me.</i>

796
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.563
Courtney, he's dangerous.

797
01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:39.941
I gotta go.

798
01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:41.943
No, Courtney, please!

799
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.111
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

800
01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:45.530
Mwah.

801
01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:52.495
So, who were you talking to?

802
01:03:53.037 --> 01:03:53.871
What's that?

803
01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:56.833
When I was coming down the hall,
I heard you talking to someone.

804
01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.253
Just a... a work call.
It was nothing.

805
01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.462
Sounded pretty tense.

806
01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.382
You know how it is.
Some people don't know

807
01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:07.426
- how to take no for an answer.
- Tell me about it.

808
01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:37.373
You shouldn't go through
other people's phones.

809
01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.543
What, why do you have
photos of Ellie on there?

810
01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:42.003
You know we're old friends.

811
01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.465
Yeah, but these are new.
Have you been following her?

812
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.011
-Janice asked me to do it.
-Her old boss?

813
01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:52.972
Yeah, she thought it was suspicious
Ellie was leaving the firm so soon,

814
01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.850
so she asked me to make sure
she wasn't compromising anything.

815
01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.060
Was she?

816
01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.063
Was she compromising anything?

817
01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.232
No.

818
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.402
Yeah, I... I think I need some air.

819
01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:12.283
Everything's gonna be just fine.

820
01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:17.330
Courtney!

821
01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:32.595
Courtney.

822
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.515
Courtney!

823
01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:48.819
God.

824
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.738
Courtney!

825
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.616
Courtney.

826
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.409
Courtney, wake up, please.

827
01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:56.702
Courtney.

828
01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:57.995
God.

829
01:05:58.704 --> 01:05:59.705
Somebody, help!

830
01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:08.923
We sent units to his apartment,
but he wasn't there. We'll find him.

831
01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:10.675
Okay.

832
01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.260
Is she gonna be all right?

833
01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.178
She's fine.

834
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:15.096
Elle.

835
01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.764
Elle, are you okay?

836
01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:19.517
Yeah, I'm okay, honey.

837
01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:22.353
-Where's Brittany?
-She's fine. She's with Scott.

838
01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:24.188
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes, yes.

839
01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:25.481
You must be the husband.

840
01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.066
I'm Detective Larson.

841
01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.944
-Can you tell me what's going on?
-Her friend was attacked.

842
01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.738
Attacked by who? What happened?

843
01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:35.533
I'm gonna send a unit
to your house until we find him.

844
01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:38.077
In the meantime,
if you need anything, anytime.

845
01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:39.286
Thank you.

846
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.457
Babe, what happened? What's going on?

847
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.543
I'm gonna tell you everything
when we get home.

848
01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:48.504
-But please, get me out of here, okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

849
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.342
I mean, this guy's out here
drinking my beer.

850
01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.887
I played golf with this son of a bitch!

851
01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.514
I don't get it.

852
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.893
I don't get it. If you guys were so close,
how come I never heard about him before?

853
01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:07.273
I haven't talked to him
since I graduated from college.

854
01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:10.484
I haven't seen him
since we graduated from college.

855
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.863
And when he showed up at the house,

856
01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.949
I didn't know how...

857
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.243
I... I didn't know how to tell you.

858
01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:20.161
So, you...

859
01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:22.580
you screw him in the bathroom?

860
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.540
I'm sorry, you almost did.

861
01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:25.916
I was drunk.

862
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.085
How do you do this to us, Elle?

863
01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:32.757
I just got caught
in a situation, and I did not...

864
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.302
I didn't know what to do.

865
01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:40.306
The last thing
that I ever wanted to do was hurt you.

866
01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:55.696
I'm sorry.

867
01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:59.075
If you were so upset
about the way things were going,

868
01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.701
why didn't you say something?

869
01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:04.705
Because I didn't know what to say.
I didn't know how to say it. I did not...

870
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.166
-I didn't know how to tell you anything.
-Elle!

871
01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:12.129
I don't understand
how you can make a living

872
01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.508
talking to 12 people in a jury box
that you don't even know...

873
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.386
and you can't talk to me?

874
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.223
I mean, Jesus,
is our life really that bad?

875
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:23.140
No.

876
01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:28.062
No, I love our life. I love our daughter.
I love the life that we've built together.

877
01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.605
I love you. I...

878
01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.152
I'm sorry.

879
01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.034
Mom.

880
01:08:43.494 --> 01:08:44.328
Dad.

881
01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:47.581
Why are there police cars outside?

882
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:49.500
Come sit, baby.

883
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:51.544
What's wrong?

884
01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:54.046
Dad?

885
01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:56.757
Just sit down.

886
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.308
So, the use of an accelerant
is gonna make DNA tests very difficult,

887
01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.394
and the dental samples
are gonna take a while to reconstruct.

888
01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:35.689
Thank you.

889
01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:38.609
However, both the handwriting
on the letter

890
01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:41.654
and the clothing on the body
appear to be a match for David.

891
01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:42.780
Yeah.

892
01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:49.286
We searched the apartment, and we
found the folders that you mentioned.

893
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:52.831
There were also a number of searches
on the computer about suicide.

894
01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:56.627
Apparently, he left a message
on his therapist's voicemail last night,

895
01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:59.088
taking responsibility for everything...

896
01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:02.007
including the murder of his ex-wife.

897
01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:04.301
My God.

898
01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:09.431
I know this isn't
quite the resolution you were hoping for.

899
01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.558
But it is a resolution.

900
01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:13.852
Yeah.

901
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.399
Um, thank you.
Thank you for everything you've done.

902
01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.276
-We appreciate you.
-Thank you.

903
01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.986
Thanks. Thank you.

904
01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:27.449
Detective.

905
01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:32.496
How's Courtney? Is there an update?

906
01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:35.332
She's doing better.
I took her statement this morning.

907
01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.293
She's got stitches, a bad concussion,

908
01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:40.212
but the doctor said she should be ready
to receive visitors tomorrow.

909
01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.047
Thank you so much.

910
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:54.518
Marcus, I'm sorry.

911
01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.605
I'm sorry for all of it.

912
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.609
You know, I remember...

913
01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.364
the first day that I realized
I was in love with you.

914
01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.245
It was like, in that moment,
everything just...

915
01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:16.206
made sense.

916
01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.131
I can't tell you that I'm not angry.

917
01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.384
And I can't tell you that I'm not hurt.

918
01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.890
But what I can say is...

919
01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:35.768
that I will always need you...

920
01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.896
for my world to make sense.

921
01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:43.650
So...

922
01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:48.947
I told you before, I'll tell you again,

923
01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.201
I guess you're stuck with me.

924
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.331
I think we're stuck with each other.

925
01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.237
Good catch.

926
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.366
<i> Low coastal clouds will be</i>
<i>rolling in later tomorrow afternoon...</i>

927
01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:33.951
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

928
01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:39.456
Look at this.

929
01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.250
It's perfect.

930
01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:46.380
There's no way
I'm going in to the office today.

931
01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:47.506
Don't.

932
01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:49.800
You know?

933
01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:54.012
We have so much to be thankful for.

934
01:13:55.055 --> 01:13:56.598
I know what I'm thankful for.

935
01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.186
You want some tea?

936
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.355
-Yeah.
-All right, I'll get some.

937
01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.110
<i>...after murdering his ex-wife</i>
<i>and her boyfriend,</i>

938
01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:11.655
<i>as well as stalking</i>
<i>an Oceancrest woman and her family.</i>

939
01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:20.372
<i>David is a textbook definition</i>

940
01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:23.167
<i>of narcissistic personality disorder.</i>

941
01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:35.888
All right, guys. We gotta get that thing
in first thing in the morning, all right?

942
01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:36.805
Eight hours.

943
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:37.723
Stick it full.

944
01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:40.976
Shoot.

945
01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:45.439
It's Linda. I need to go to the office
and sign some documents

946
01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:46.482
before the holiday.

947
01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.817
-It's almost dark.
-No, I know. I'll be quick.

948
01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:49.818
All right.

949
01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.237
- Bye, guys. Have fun.
- Bye.

950
01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.741
-Bring us a pizza. We're hungry.
-I will.

951
01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.994
Hey, don't make me come down there now.

952
01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.814
Linda, I'm here!

953
01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.115
No. No.

954
01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.493
<i>You left them alone.</i>

955
01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.245
David.

956
01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:34.131
This is Detective Larson.

957
01:16:34.464 --> 01:16:36.717
David is still alive.

958
01:16:37.217 --> 01:16:38.760
Ellie? Slow down.

959
01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.095
Where are you now?

960
01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:43.265
I'm in my car. I'm driving to my house.

961
01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:44.349
<i>No one's answering.</i>

962
01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.519
Please.
Get someone over there now.

963
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.188
Ellie. Ellie!

964
01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:57.237
It's Detective Larson. I need units sent
to 57 Shore Road immediately.

965
01:17:08.373 --> 01:17:09.416
Marcus!

966
01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:10.709
Brittany!

967
01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:33.357
This is such a great song, right?

968
01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:35.734
What are you doing?

969
01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:37.986
Remember that party senior year?

970
01:17:39.279 --> 01:17:41.948
They must have played
this entire album, like, twice.

971
01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.049
Come on, dance with me.

972
01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.010
Come on.

973
01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.637
David, where's my husband?

974
01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:09.643
Where's my...
Where's my daughter?

975
01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:11.520
I'm disappointed.

976
01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:14.940
You would think a man
would put up much more of a fight

977
01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:16.483
for the woman that he loves.

978
01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:19.653
Marcus?

979
01:18:21.988 --> 01:18:22.906
Brittany?

980
01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:25.992
Ellie...

981
01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:29.579
I know you think you love him.

982
01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:32.457
But way down deep...

983
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:36.378
you realize you made a mistake,
and that's okay.

984
01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.505
We all make mistakes.

985
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:43.301
The important thing is
we can be together now.

986
01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:46.346
We can start a brand-new life.

987
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:51.351
Maybe you're right.

988
01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.147
I knew you'd come around.

989
01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.951
It's like my psychiatrist used to say.

990
01:19:08.952 --> 01:19:13.331
Sometimes you just gotta put the past
in the rearview mirror and move on.

991
01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.458
Yeah.

992
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:21.506
I don't wanna hurt you.

993
01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:23.592
David, please!

994
01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:26.136
I just believe some things
are worth fighting for.

995
01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.605
Marcus! Marcus!

996
01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.524
- Ellie!
- Honey?

997
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.234
- Marcus!
- Help!

998
01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.904
God!

999
01:19:43.987 --> 01:19:45.822
Here. Sweetheart!

1000
01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:47.407
God!

1001
01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:49.534
Mom!

1002
01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.456
Honey, are you okay?

1003
01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.625
God.

1004
01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.505
-Where is he now?
-He's upstairs. Hold on. Lean forward.

1005
01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.051
Here. Here.

1006
01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:10.514
The police are here.

1007
01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:14.184
He's upstairs.

1008
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.061
-Come on.
-He's upstairs.

1009
01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:17.979
Go. Go!

1010
01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:21.233
Go. Go. Go. Go.

1011
01:20:23.443 --> 01:20:24.945
Come on. Come on.

1012
01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.824
-Scott!
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, come on!

1013
01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:32.869
Elle, come on!

1014
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.207
Go! Hurry.

1015
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:41.336
Hey, we need help!

1016
01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:43.964
- My God.
- Hey, go see if you can call for help.

1017
01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:45.799
I'll get Brittany out of here.

1018
01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:50.971
Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on, get in the car.

1019
01:20:51.054 --> 01:20:52.931
Get in the car. Brittany, get in the car!

1020
01:20:53.473 --> 01:20:55.767
Hello? Is anyone there?

1021
01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:58.186
Somebody, please, help me.

1022
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.521
Please, somebody.

1023
01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.818
Can anyone hear me?

1024
01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:08.780
Hello?

1025
01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:09.865
Come here.

1026
01:21:11.449 --> 01:21:12.492
Brittany, go!

1027
01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:20.917
Let her go.

1028
01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:04.461
Come on, babe. Come on!

1029
01:22:04.544 --> 01:22:06.463
Go. Go. Go.

1030
01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:44.834
Marcus.

1031
01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:49.381
David, no!

1032
01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.340
Ellie...

1033
01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:53.385
I never meant for things
to get out of hand.

1034
01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.096
Please. David, please, put the gun down.

1035
01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:58.098
Even now he's abandoning you.

1036
01:22:58.181 --> 01:22:59.808
Okay. Okay.

1037
01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:01.935
Okay, just calm down.

1038
01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:04.145
Can't you see
we were meant to be together?

1039
01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:05.981
David.

1040
01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.526
-Please.
-Let me make it up to you.

1041
01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:10.860
We'll start over.

1042
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.488
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1043
01:23:14.906 --> 01:23:16.449
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

1044
01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:29.963
Honey, are you okay?

1045
01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.556
David!

1046
01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:42.142
No! No!

1047
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.768
I got you!

1048
01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.145
David, hold on!

1049
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:50.066
I got you, Elle. I got you, baby.

1050
01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:53.194
I got you. I got you.

1051
01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.123
All right.

1052
01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:50.043
So you're leaving us already?

1053
01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:54.172
Well, you're not paying that tuition
for me to sit around here, are you?

1054
01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.091
I'm not. I'm not.

1055
01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.137
I love you.

1056
01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:02.388
Love you, too.

1057
01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:04.682
Call me when you get there.

1058
01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:07.602
And then every day after that
so I know you're okay.

1059
01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:10.438
I will. Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.

1060
01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:12.273
-Okay? Love you guys.
-I love you, baby.

1061
01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:16.528
- See you soon.
- Bye.

1062
01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:18.071
Drive safe.

1063
01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:23.910
Put your seat belt on.

1064
01:25:28.748 --> 01:25:29.582
I love you.

1065
01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.084
I love you, too, babe.

1066
01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:33.169
I'm so sorry.

1067
01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.004
Stop. Stop.

1068
01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:38.258
-Can't wait to get back to the city.
-Yeah. Me, too.

1069
01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.052
-Come on. I'll cook you some dinner.
-Nice.

1070
01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:42.303
Steak or salmon?

1071
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.847
Definitely steak.

1071
01:25:44.305 --> 01:26:44.908
