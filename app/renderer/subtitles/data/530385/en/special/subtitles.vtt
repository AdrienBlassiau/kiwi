00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.336
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

3
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.646
<i>The Ardor residence.</i>

4
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.437
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

5
00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:59.909
<i>Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. It's Dani.</i>

6
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.112
<i>Uh, I'm sorry to be calling so late.</i>

7
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.242
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

8
00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.328
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

9
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.829
<i>Listen,
I got kind of a scary e-mail from Terri</i>

10
00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.414
<i>and she hasn't been responding.</i>

11
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.715
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

12
00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:20.763
<i>But, yeah, it sounds like you guys
have been fighting or something happened.</i>

13
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.555
<i>Anyway, I just got a little worried.</i>

14
00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.602
<i>So, um, if you can call when you can.</i>

15
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.850
<i>And of course you know I'm always here</i>

16
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.182
<i>if you need anything, of course.</i>

17
00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:38.065
Okay, um, I love you. All right, bye.

18
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.936
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

19
00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.138
What are you up to?

20
00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:57.648
<i>Just smoked some resin with Mark,
and now we're getting pizza.</i>

21
00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.855
- Oh, nice.
<i>- Hi, Dani.</i>

22
00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.235
<i>- Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani. Hi Dani.
- Yeah, um...</i>

23
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:05.326
<i>he's saying hi right now, over and over.</i>

24
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.404
- Hi, Mark.
<i>- Hi, Mark.</i>

25
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:14.961
So I was calling just to see if you...
you still wanted to hang out later.

26
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.213
<i>Oh.</i>

27
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.758
<i>Did we talk about doing something tonight?</i>

28
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:25.296
I mean, not... not concretely,
but I just wanted to see.

29
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.264
<i>Um...</i>

30
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.930
<i>Well, okay.</i>

31
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.807
<i>Yeah, I should be able to swing by.</i>

32
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.138
- Cool.
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

33
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.944
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

34
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.357
Um, well...

35
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.452
Uh, yeah, um...

36
00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.036
I've e-mailed her three times, and...

37
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.416
still no response,
so I'm getting a little bit nervous.

38
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.341
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

39
00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.168
- Yeah, probably.
<i>- She does this every other day, Dani.</i>

40
00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.673
<i>And only because you let her.</i>

41
00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.181
- Well, I don't let her. She's bipolar.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

42
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:13.056
<i>But you do, though, babes.
You go straight to crisis mode.</i>

43
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.729
Well, she's my sister,

44
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:19.435
and even you said
that this e-mail seemed different.

45
00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.360
<i>Yeah, right, but...</i>

46
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.855
<i>...is it though, really?</i>

47
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.066
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention,</i>

48
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.447
<i>just like every other panic attack
she's given you.</i>

49
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:31.914
Yeah, you're right.

50
00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.410
You are right. Yeah, I know.

51
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.897
<i>I mean, the more you respond,
the more she's encouraged to keep...</i>

52
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.163
No, I know, I know, I know. You're right.

53
00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:42.340
I just... I just needed to be reminded.
Thank you.

54
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.255
I'm very lucky to have you.

55
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.681
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

56
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:50.882
I love you.

57
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:54.645
<i>I love you.</i>

58
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.099
Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

59
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.274
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

60
00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.361
- Bye, Mark.
<i>- Bye, Mark.</i>

61
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.440
Okay, I love you.

62
00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.945
<i>- All right.</i>
- Bye.

63
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.392
It's in his tone.
Like, you can hear it in his voice.

64
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.296
He's just working up the nerve
to say something.

65
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.996
<i>So be direct. Confront him.</i>

66
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.023
What if I've scared him, though?
I'm always roping him into my family crap.

67
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.539
<i>- How do you rope him in?</i>
- I'm always leaning on him!

68
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.153
Like, I even called him today in tears

69
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.756
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary e-mail.

70
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.178
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

71
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.094
What if I'm scaring him off?

72
00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.425
<i>What did your sister write?</i>

73
00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:38.934
Just some ominous bullshit
like she always does, and it's torture.

74
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.936
And I lean on him constantly for support.

75
00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.518
Like, what if I have overwhelmed him,

76
00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:45.729
and he thinks that
I just have too much baggage?

77
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.939
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

78
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.118
No, not if I went too far,
if I leaned too much.

79
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.570
<i>You didn't. He should be there
when you need him.</i>

80
00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.623
Yeah, but what if I need him too often,
and it becomes a chore?

81
00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.996
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

82
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:03.166
<i>Because it shouldn't ever be a chore.
Would it be a chore if he leaned on you?</i>

83
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.985
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me for anything.
I've never even seen him cry,

84
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.625
so I'm the only one that's leaning.

85
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.185
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

86
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.213
<i>The only one making yourself vulnerable.</i>

87
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:13.343
<i>That's intimacy.</i>

88
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:14.808
Dude.

89
00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.635
You have gotta get off the fence
with this.

90
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.628
What if I regret it later,
and I can't get her back?

91
00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.314
- You don't want her back.
- But I might.

92
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.278
Okay, well then you can

93
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.732
bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

94
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.316
and then we'll remind you again

95
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.180
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

96
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:38.039
for, like, a year now, and then you can
find a chick who actually likes sex

97
00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.144
and doesn't drag you
through a million hoops every day.

98
00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.626
Do you think that there is
a masochistic part of you

99
00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.453
that is playing out this particular drama

100
00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.755
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

101
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.377
What work do I need to be doing,
Josh, exactly?

102
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.714
Well, I don't know.
Your prospectus, maybe? Your PhD?

103
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.925
Wow. Okay, thanks for the psychoanalysis.

104
00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.634
It's not about academics, Josh.

105
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.414
- I'm just trying to get you focused.
- Change?

106
00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.929
That's for you.

107
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.818
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

108
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.675
And don't forget about all the Swedish
women you can impregnate in June.

109
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.031
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget about

110
00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.278
all the Swedish milkmaids.

111
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.157
That's not her again.

112
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.617
Seriously?

113
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.245
Oh, my God.

114
00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.418
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

115
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.712
Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

116
00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.084
It's literally abuse.

117
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.540
- She's abusing you.
- Excuse me.

118
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.626
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

119
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.211
Okay, excuse me, guys.

120
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.636
Well, great.

121
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.392
- Hey.
<i>- No!</i>

122
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:49.318
- Dani, babe?
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>

123
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:32.641
No, no, no, no, no!

124
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.162
Hey, babe.

125
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.669
How you feeling?

126
00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.718
I'm up.

127
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:29.844
Where are you going?

128
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.931
I was just gonna go to that party
for 45 minutes.

129
00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.307
But you just keep sleeping.

130
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.433
No.

131
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.684
No, I'll come with you.

132
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.595
You sure you've had enough sleep?

133
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.358
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

134
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.613
Yeah, I'm fucking dreading
the summer.

135
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.489
Stuck in shit-ass Boulder, listening
to my stepmom fuck my dad all day.

136
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.200
I'll listen to your stepmom
fuck your dad.

137
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.156
Josh, weren't you going to Europe?

138
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.663
Yeah, for my thesis.
Now we all are.

139
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.162
Oh, you're all going?

140
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.420
Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Hälsingland.

141
00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:05.584
- Sweden.
- Oh.

142
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.386
Any occasion, or is it just for fun?

143
00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.720
Well, I'm going for research.

144
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.517
These guys are just tagging along.

145
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:19.561
Mr. Pelle's invited us to an authentic
hippie midsummer at his yodeling farm.

146
00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.029
Oh, yeah?

147
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.155
I mean, we were talking about it.

148
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.907
We were thinking about it.

149
00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:32.661
For when?

150
00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.539
Mid-June to mid-July?

151
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.492
Yeah, two weeks from now?

152
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:39.667
Yeah.

153
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.711
I mean, that's if we even go.

154
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.464
I'm probably not gonna go, but...

155
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.587
Yeah, we were talking about it.

156
00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:28.885
You okay?

157
00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.303
Mm-hmm. Fine.

158
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.180
That was just really weird.

159
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.022
What was?

160
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.655
The...

161
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.232
Sweden.

162
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:54.867
I had no idea.

163
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.248
Well, what do you mean?
'Cause I told you I wanted to go.

164
00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.376
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

165
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.668
I just decided today.

166
00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:14.220
I wasn't keeping it from you.

167
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.923
You already have a ticket.

168
00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.021
I'm sorry?

169
00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.439
Okay. Well, just...

170
00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:32.235
imagine if you were at a party,
and someone said,

171
00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.408
"Hey, what are you doing for summer?"

172
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.735
And then my friend said...

173
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:40.331
"Oh, we're going to China for three months
and we're leaving in two weeks."

174
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.311
- It's Sweden, for a month and a half.
- And it was the first

175
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.327
- you'd ever heard of it.
- Okay.

176
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.036
I told you I wanted to go to Sweden.

177
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.630
No, you said it would be cool to go.

178
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.110
Yeah and then I got the opportunity

179
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.029
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

180
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.215
I just wish
you would've told me, that's all.

181
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.967
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

182
00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.926
You didn't apologize. You said "sorry,"
which sounds more like "too bad."

183
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.188
- Maybe I should just go home.
- What? No, no.

184
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.653
I'm just trying to understand.

185
00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:15.441
- And I'm trying to apologize.
- And I don't need an apology. I don't.

186
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.527
I just wanted to talk about it,
that's all.

187
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.018
- I really think I should just leave.
- No, no, no, no.

188
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.580
Please, please, please.
I'm not trying to attack you. I'm not.

189
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.413
- It really feels like you are.
- Well, then, I'm sorry.

190
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.839
I just got confused. I'm sorry. I...

191
00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.088
Hey, please, come on. Can you come...

192
00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.239
- Just can you come...
- Just stop.

193
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.470
...and sit with me, please?

194
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.922
Please, and we can talk about it?

195
00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.809
Look, it just felt really weird, okay?

196
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:45.012
But I'm fine. I think it's great
that you're going to Sweden, I do.

197
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.098
I think it's amazing.

198
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.896
Are you going for your thesis?

199
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.236
I don't know what my thesis is.

200
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.948
I know, and it can... it will...

201
00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.742
It can be inspiring, right?

202
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:02.956
Right?

203
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.750
Hey.

204
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.869
Please, I overreacted. I'm sorry.

205
00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.173
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.712
I know I get paranoid.

207
00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:17.510
I don't mean to.

208
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.466
I know I overreacted, but I've been
trying to pull myself back up,

209
00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:25.098
and I've been trying to deal
with this panic and my fears.

210
00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:28.225
I didn't mean to put pressure on you
or to blame you for anything...

211
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.876
- Okay.
- I just got crazy for a second,

212
00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.503
- and I didn't mean to project.
- Okay. Okay.

213
00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:32.688
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

214
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.531
It's fine.

215
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:41.947
- I am sorry.
- It's fine.

216
00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.288
I was gonna ask you
if you wanted to come with me.

217
00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.304
What?

218
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.177
- What do you mean?
- What I just said.

219
00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:08.605
To Sweden?

220
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:11.775
Mm-hmm.

221
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.903
You don't want me to go.

222
00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.690
I just asked.

223
00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.902
- Yeah, after I broke down crying.
- Well, you ruined the surprise.

224
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.456
I wanted it to be romantic.

225
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.254
In Stockholm,
are there any, like, meatball sex clubs

226
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.010
we should hit up before we head north?

227
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.883
No, we're going straight north.

228
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.040
Not straight-straight, though, right?

229
00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.744
We gotta go through Stockholm
to get there.

230
00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.517
No, it's the opposite direction.
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

231
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.443
Guys, it's Dani.

232
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.529
She's coming up.

233
00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:00.573
Okay.

234
00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.442
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

235
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.286
Um, I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

236
00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.504
So you guys know.

237
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.752
She's not actually gonna come,

238
00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.210
but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

239
00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:25.304
- You invited her to...
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.553
But she's not coming.

241
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:30.518
She doesn't want to?

242
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.857
I invited her, and she accepted,

243
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:38.105
but she's not actually coming to Sweden.

244
00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.486
Okay.

245
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.002
Guys, you know what
she's been going through.

246
00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:49.405
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh...

247
00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.268
- thought you were...
- Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

248
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.228
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

249
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.252
Okay, that's great.

250
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:59.665
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her,

251
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.001
and you all know that she's coming,
agreed?

252
00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.630
Yep.

253
00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.303
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

254
00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:07.847
Hey, guys.

255
00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:08.969
- Hey.
- Yo.

256
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.017
How's it going?

257
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:14.062
We're chilling.

258
00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.148
Nice.

259
00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:19.192
So, Sweden.

260
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.506
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

261
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.691
I mean, I...

262
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:27.109
I guess so, if that's not
completely ruining you guys' plans.

263
00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.115
- No, no.
- No, not at all.

264
00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.263
Christian, can I get you to take a look
at this paragraph real quick?

265
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.872
Yeah, sure.

266
00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.979
- I'll be back.
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.549
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

268
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:00.893
What were you drawing?

269
00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:02.694
Uh, just the table.

270
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.896
Oh.

271
00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:06.366
How have you been?

272
00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.034
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

273
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.905
Survived finals, so...

274
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.078
You know. And you?

275
00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:14.205
Uh...

276
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:17.955
I didn't... I didn't quite finish,
but they're giving me a break this year.

277
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.629
Oh, God, yes. Yes, of course. Sorry.

278
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:24.708
No, it's, uh... How did you like
the anthropology department?

279
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.595
I like it, yeah.
Not as much as this one maybe, but...

280
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:32.928
You're doing psychiatry, right?

281
00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:34.885
Uh, psychology, yeah.

282
00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:37.141
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

283
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:39.348
Yeah. Also that funny look in your eye.

284
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.851
So you're coming to Hälsingland?

285
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.853
I guess so, yeah.

286
00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:47.860
And, um, we'll actually be arriving
on my birthday.

287
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.442
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

288
00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:55.706
Yeah, Christian says
you've got this special week planned.

289
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:59.455
Yeah. It's sort of a crazy
nine-day festival my family's doing.

290
00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:03.084
Lots of pageantry and special ceremonies
and dressing up.

291
00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:04.334
That sounds fun.

292
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:06.833
It'll probably seem very silly.

293
00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:08.589
But it's like theater.

294
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.716
Yeah, Christian says you're...

295
00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.968
you're from, like, a commune, right?

296
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.425
Yeah, we're a small community.

297
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.514
Here.

298
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:18.937
I'll show you.

299
00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.236
Oh, wow.

300
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.611
I see what you mean about the pageantry.

301
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.233
Yeah, we make those clothes special
for every winter and summer solstice.

302
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.782
We... I mean, everybody sort of does
everything together.

303
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:36.033
That's an interesting symbol.

304
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:39.207
Yeah. It's our special little language.

305
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:41.371
Whoa, who's that one?

306
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.787
That's last year's May queen.

307
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:45.247
Oh.

308
00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:46.502
Beautiful.

309
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.673
You know,
I'm very, very glad you're coming.

310
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.889
I... I think it's very good you're coming.

311
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.183
Thank you.

312
00:23:58.312 --> 00:23:59.312
Also, I...

313
00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:02.104
I never had the chance to tell you,

314
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:03.807
but I was...

315
00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:07.811
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

316
00:24:08.822 --> 00:24:10.814
- Oh.
- What happened. I mean, I...

317
00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:12.903
can't even imagine.

318
00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:14.908
I mean...

319
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.736
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

320
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.071
I kind of have some idea.

321
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:20.289
- I'm sorry.
- No!

322
00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:21.662
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

323
00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:23.960
I'm gonna just go to the bathroom.
Thank you.

324
00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:16.032
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

325
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:19.015
<i>we are beginning our initial descent
into Stockholm Arlanda.</i>

326
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.767
<i>The temperature right now...</i>

327
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.644
Oh, my God, the women here.

328
00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:33.070
What is it that makes them hotter?

329
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.586
The Vikings grabbed
all the best babes from other countries...

330
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:38.822
and dragged them over.

331
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.656
How long is the drive?

332
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.161
About four hours.

333
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:45.742
Oh, my God.

334
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:49.170
I saw a video,
and it wasn't even like... It wasn't fake.

335
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:52.123
And there was this one woman
with three clits.

336
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.251
Actually. For real.

337
00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:56.927
...sensitive about Hiroshima?

338
00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.300
I am, actually.

339
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.131
- Trail of Tears?
- Yeah.

340
00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:02.763
- Slavery?
- Dude, what do you think?

341
00:26:02.853 --> 00:26:05.311
Like, imagine
trying to take a dude seriously,

342
00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.229
and he's, like, reading out the news,

343
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:10.480
and you know he, like,
bludgeoned his wife with a pan.

344
00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:50.012
Why are you reading that?

345
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.066
Ask Pelle.

346
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.734
We're taught the runic alphabet
in my village,

347
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:59.316
so Josh just carries that around
to annoy me.

348
00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:00.409
Oh.

349
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:02.990
What are you doing your thesis on again?

350
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:07.832
Uh, well, my focus is actually
on European midsummer traditions,

351
00:27:07.918 --> 00:27:12.128
which was basically the impetus
for this whole trip that we're all on.

352
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.673
Hey, that sounds similar
to what you're thinking of doing, right?

353
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:17.675
For your thesis?

354
00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:22.930
Well, I don't know exactly
what I'm doing it on yet, as you know.

355
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:26.350
But I'm thinking of rooting it
in something Scandinavian, yeah.

356
00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:29.313
See that, Pelle?

357
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:31.737
You've managed to brainwash
all of your friends.

358
00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:35.231
Josh was already brainwashed
when I found him.

359
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.060
Okay, this is the first stop.

360
00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:53.062
This is it?

361
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:54.639
Not quite. Almost.

362
00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:00.988
Pelle!

363
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.990
- Hey!
- Hey!

364
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:04.219
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

365
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:06.826
Okay, guys, so these are
younger people from my village.

366
00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:08.792
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

367
00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:10.539
Come on over.

368
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:13.578
Hey!

369
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.622
These are my friends from America.

370
00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:19.672
Oh, dude.

371
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:21.801
Just fuckin' walk.

372
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:23.501
Yeah, dude, there's so many bugs.

373
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:24.906
- You're not seeing this?
- It's beautiful, huh?

374
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.930
Mm-hmm.

375
00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:32.844
Okay, so this is

376
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.305
- Mark, Dani, Christian and Josh.
- Hi.

377
00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:38.475
What?

378
00:29:38.986 --> 00:29:40.522
Give me just one second.

379
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:44.133
- You think he knows that guy?
- He sounded mad.

380
00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:03.716
Here. Come on over. Come on over.

381
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:07.219
This is...
These are my great friends from America.

382
00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:09.263
- Christian, Dani, Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

383
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.216
Meet my brother, Ingemar.

384
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:13.454
Best friends since we were babies,
actually.

385
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.719
Yeah.

386
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:17.271
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

387
00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.102
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

388
00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:21.275
Awesome! And say hello to my friends.

389
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:23.648
- This is Simon and Connie from London.
- Hi.

390
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:24.946
- How's it going?
- Hi.

391
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:26.648
Simon and Connie, this is Pelle.

392
00:30:26.742 --> 00:30:30.235
And these are all the names
I just learned two seconds ago.

393
00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:36.575
Perfect timing, by the way.
We just took these five minutes ago.

394
00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.204
Haven't even started coming up yet.

395
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:41.128
Oh, shit!

396
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:44.048
Do you guys wanna take it now,
or should we settle in first?

397
00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:46.054
- Fuck it. Let's just take it now, right?
- Yeah.

398
00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:47.422
Great.

399
00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:51.131
You know what? I might have to
find my footing first, if that's okay.

400
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.678
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

401
00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:57.564
And, listen, if you're feeling uneasy,
you don't have to take them at all.

402
00:30:57.606 --> 00:31:00.394
No, no, no.
I just... I wanna feel settled first.

403
00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:01.484
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:05.065
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

405
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:06.362
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

406
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.064
I want us to come up together.

407
00:31:08.158 --> 00:31:09.490
- Ready?
- Okay?

408
00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:12.952
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

409
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:17.498
Dude,
we can't take them at different times.

410
00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:18.995
They'll be totally separate trips.

411
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.995
You wanna wait for us then?

412
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.365
You know what? It's fine, it's fine.

413
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:32.005
- Babe, no.
- I'm... It's... I'm ready.

414
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.326
- No, it's okay.
- Don't feel rushed.

415
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.932
I don't. It's fine. I'm ready.

416
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:37.853
Are you sure?

417
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.306
Yes, Mark, thank you.

418
00:31:42.192 --> 00:31:43.649
They've made mushroom tea.

419
00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.522
If you prefer against the taste.

420
00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:47.854
Uh, yeah, okay. I'll try that. Thank you.

421
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:48.984
"Ingmar"? "Ingemar."

422
00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.066
- Ingemar. Perfect.
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.

423
00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:55.069
- Don't let Mark pressure you.
- He's not.

424
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:56.641
- Of all people.
- He's not, he's not.

425
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:58.657
It will get complicated otherwise.
It's fine.

426
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.286
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

427
00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:01.959
- There you go.
- Ooh.

428
00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:03.081
Thanks, dude.

429
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:04.287
Okay, here we go then.

430
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.609
- Think happy thoughts!
- You sure about this?

431
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.875
- Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers.

432
00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:11.635
- All right.
- Yeah?

433
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:13.846
Are you sure about this?

434
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.548
I think it's gonna be fun.

435
00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.391
- Ready?
- Yep, go.

436
00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.311
What time is it?

437
00:32:26.445 --> 00:32:27.777
It's 9:00 p.m.

438
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.064
What do you mean?

439
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.112
What do you mean?

440
00:32:35.662 --> 00:32:37.654
That can't be right. The sky is blue.

441
00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:40.323
It's fine. It's Sweden.

442
00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:43.493
That's not fine. Why is it like that?

443
00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:46.579
It's okay, Mark. It's the midnight sun.

444
00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:48.998
That feels wrong. I don't like that.

445
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:51.508
I promise you, it's okay.

446
00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:52.802
I'm not okay.

447
00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:54.754
Oh, fuck. It's a new person.

448
00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:55.848
What?

449
00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:57.719
I don't want new people right now.

450
00:32:58.602 --> 00:33:01.094
No, new people are good, Mark.

451
00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:03.433
Hi, hi!

452
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:09.440
- I'm just gonna lay down, okay?
- Yeah, do that.

453
00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.482
Everybody else lay down.

454
00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.068
Guys, do it. It feels so nice.

455
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:21.822
Josh, can you lie down, please?

456
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:25.084
Can you feel that?

457
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:27.537
The energy,

458
00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:29.088
coming up from the earth?

459
00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:43.979
Look.

460
00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:46.688
The trees, too, they're breathing.

461
00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:58.071
Nature just knows instinctually
how to stay in harmony.

462
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:03.539
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

463
00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:13.252
You guys are, like, my family.

464
00:34:16.846 --> 00:34:18.508
You're, like, my real, actual family.

465
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:22.434
Dani?

466
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:26.808
Sorry.

467
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.932
I'm gonna... go for a walk.

468
00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:31.565
I can walk too.

469
00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:34.437
Sor... No, I'm gonna...

470
00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:38.816
No, no, no, no, no.

471
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:43.530
Don't think that.
You're fine. It's almost your birthday.

472
00:34:43.623 --> 00:34:47.742
You're okay. You're fine.
You're fine. You're fine.

473
00:34:55.552 --> 00:34:57.919
No, stop it! You're fine.

474
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.505
Hey, Dani!

475
00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:04.509
How are you?

476
00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:07.807
They were laughing at me.

477
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:10.230
What? No, no, no. I'm sure they weren't.

478
00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:13.059
They've been laughing.

479
00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:15.770
You want to come meet my friends?

480
00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:22.276
Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

481
00:35:28.168 --> 00:35:32.287
Stop it! Stop it. Fuck!

482
00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:39.009
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.

483
00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.247
Hey.

484
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.298
How long was I asleep?

485
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:30.516
I mean... we found you here,
like, six hours ago.

486
00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:38.981
Did it get dark at all?

487
00:36:41.658 --> 00:36:43.775
For a couple hours. Not completely.

488
00:36:46.246 --> 00:36:47.453
Is it tomorrow?

489
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:51.199
I mean, from yesterday's perspective.

490
00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:57.083
Come on.

491
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.591
Where are we going?

492
00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:03.298
Where we came for.

493
00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:44.714
Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

494
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.388
Yeah, this is
way the hell out there.

495
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.848
Do they have ticks in Sweden?

496
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.221
Sweden has a tick problem.

497
00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.394
What? No, they don't. Do they really?

498
00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:00.192
Actually, it is a big problem.

499
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:03.862
Last summer a record number of people
got tick-borne encephalitis.

500
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.110
What the fuck? Are you serious?

501
00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:08.363
Yeah,
both my grandparents died from ticks.

502
00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:10.194
Had to give them a closed-casket funeral.

503
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:13.952
Okay.
Josh, I actually have an uncle with Lyme.

504
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:17.331
And believe me, you ask him, it was not
worth the pleasant picnic in the park.

505
00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:18.879
He's fucked.

506
00:39:02.549 --> 00:39:04.256
So this is is the place.

507
00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:06.959
The tranquil and majestic Hårga.

508
00:39:09.389 --> 00:39:11.149
Pelle, you know all these people?

509
00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:13.390
These are my family.

510
00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:21.166
So we're stopping in Waco
before going to Pelle's village?

511
00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:36.368
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

512
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:39.124
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

513
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.951
- No, rhubarb.
- Oh, wow. Thank you.

514
00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.786
This bag?

515
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:43.997
Thank you... sorry.

516
00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:47.750
Hey, guys?

517
00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:49.301
Meet my sister, Dagny.

518
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:51.128
Born on the exact same day as me.

519
00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:54.056
- Hi.
- Say hi to Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

520
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.039
Thank you.

521
00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.423
- Thanks.
- Hey.

522
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:13.118
Father Odd.

523
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:33.713
Sorry. These are my friends.

524
00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:36.173
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

525
00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:38.637
- Hello.
- Hi.

526
00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:39.809
- Hello.
- Hey.

527
00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:41.762
- Hello, hello. Welcome, welcome.
- Hi.

528
00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:43.438
- Hi. Oh!
- Welcome home.

529
00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:48.899
- We are so very happy to have you.
- Thank you.

530
00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:51.776
Pelle has an immaculate sense for people.

531
00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.158
I love what you're wearing.

532
00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:57.531
My frock? Quite girly, no?

533
00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.539
We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

534
00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:03.959
and because of the nature's...

535
00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:08.335
her... "hermaphrodite," I think?
These qualities.

536
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:12.626
Wow. I think the sakhis saints
do the same thing in Brajbhoomi.

537
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.047
So, we are your hosts.

538
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:20.217
So whatever you need, just say so,
and we will accommodate, okay?

539
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.802
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

540
00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.353
Today is all festivities...

541
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:28.017
just tomorrow the official ceremony begin,
and you are welcome.

542
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:30.478
- Welcome. Welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

543
00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.437
Yeah. Enjoy.

544
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.364
Yes. Thank you.

545
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:38.952
- That guy has a very red face.
- Yeah.

546
00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:44.579
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:53.519
- Can I take photos?
- Um, discreetly.

548
00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:57.908
Thanks.

549
00:42:58.993 --> 00:42:59.993
Oh, forgive me.

550
00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:03.196
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

551
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.244
Welcome to Hårga...

552
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:08.659
and happy midsummer.

553
00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:12.705
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast,

554
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:16.341
and it will be 90 years before our next.

555
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:21.172
And what poetry that it's now the hottest
and brightest summer on record.

556
00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:24.266
We already have so much to give back.

557
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:29.351
And so, without any further blathering,
let's raise our glasses.

558
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:35.565
And let our Nine-Day Feast commence.

559
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:37.320
<i>Skål!</i>

560
00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:39.068
<i>Skål!</i>

561
00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:40.195
You know, that fire
hasn't burned out since I was born.

562
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:41.881
It's all of our jobs to keep it going.

563
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:43.428
- Oh.
- Yeah.

564
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.255
Wait, what did you say?

565
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.307
I'll tell you later.

566
00:46:16.565 --> 00:46:17.976
He's giving thanks.

567
00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:19.690
For the food?

568
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.689
Yeah, and the weather and the crops.

569
00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:10.450
Was that praying?

570
00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:15.114
Maybe not praying,
but he was just addressing the...

571
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:17.665
the everything...
the harmony and the balance.

572
00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:22.542
Can I get a translation of what was sung?

573
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:25.214
Yeah, I can get a translation
from him later.

574
00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.718
Yeah, thanks. That would be amazing.

575
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.175
Sure.

576
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:32.301
Yes. Thank you, Pelle.

577
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:35.137
Of course.

578
00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:26.234
You guys should join.

579
00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.446
Oh, no. I'm too scared.

580
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.537
- All right.
- Thanks, babe.

581
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:43.418
What are the kids playing?

582
00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:45.249
Skin the fool.

583
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.877
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

584
00:48:48.968 --> 00:48:49.968
Precious.

585
00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:11.067
Hey, Pelle, can anyone just join in?

586
00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:14.278
You're an American.
Just jam yourself in there.

587
00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:19.992
Hey.

588
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.250
Happy birthday.

589
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.662
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

590
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:30.047
It's just something I do for birthdays.

591
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:31.778
Maybe it's not appropriate?

592
00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:35.136
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

593
00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:37.342
It's beautiful.

594
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:39.800
Anyway, just between us.

595
00:49:41.187 --> 00:49:42.303
Yeah, well...

596
00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:46.231
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

597
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:48.151
Oh.

598
00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:53.022
No, no, no, no. I forgot to remind him,
and it's not his fault. It's...

599
00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:57.200
Never mind. It's okay.
This is... This is beautiful.

600
00:49:57.286 --> 00:49:59.494
Thank you so much. I'm really touched.

601
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:04.244
So, how do you support this place?

602
00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:06.577
Lumbering, linen, homeopathics...

603
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.127
Water power plant.

604
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.335
School time over here.

605
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.884
- Carving runes.
- Really?

606
00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:19.715
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

607
00:50:19.808 --> 00:50:21.720
- Aw.
- Oh, yeah. I do that too.

608
00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:25.266
- Oh, fuck. There's a big one.
- Oh, shit.

609
00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:27.723
What alphabet is that from?

610
00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:31.018
The Younger Futhark?

611
00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:33.148
I think. Or is that medieval?

612
00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:35.356
Actually, that is the Elder Futhark.

613
00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:38.073
So, how long have you two been together?

614
00:50:38.744 --> 00:50:40.485
- Oh, geez. Um...
- Um...

615
00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:42.537
Just over three and a half years.

616
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:44.748
Four years.

617
00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:47.325
- No. Really?
- Yeah.

618
00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:48.830
Four years and two weeks.

619
00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.455
You're right. I'm sorry. You're right.

620
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.086
- Mm-hmm.
- Four years.

621
00:50:56.428 --> 00:50:59.512
Yeah. Um, how did you guys all meet?

622
00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:02.515
Well...

623
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:04.809
we were all working on the same farm,

624
00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:09.435
and, funny enough, I was dating Connie
when Simon and me first became pals.

625
00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:12.066
Well, we'd been on a date.

626
00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:14.631
And I didn't even actually know
it was a date, so...

627
00:51:14.655 --> 00:51:17.739
You're right. No, no, I meant that
Connie and me had just become friends.

628
00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:19.657
We decided to be friends.

629
00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:23.327
And that was just before
Connie and Simon started dating.

630
00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:24.621
And now they're engaged.

631
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:26.573
- What?
- Wow.

632
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:29.785
- Congratulations.
- Which is amazing. Yes, congratulations.

633
00:51:30.546 --> 00:51:33.960
Thanks. Yeah, we actually asked Ingemar
to officiate the wedding.

634
00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:35.665
- Really?
- Nah.

635
00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.921
- Oh.
- What's that building over there?

636
00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:42.051
It's like a sacred temple,
but no one's allowed in there.

637
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:46.013
Let me show you where we sleep.

638
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:49.062
Let me show you the <i>Rotvälta.</i>

639
00:51:50.482 --> 00:51:52.269
So we're just gonna ignore the bear then?

640
00:51:53.235 --> 00:51:54.235
It's a bear.

641
00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:00.658
What's that?

642
00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:03.197
We can check it out.

643
00:52:13.422 --> 00:52:14.629
A little love story.

644
00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:55.920
Oh! Wow. What? Wow.

645
00:52:59.885 --> 00:53:00.885
Wow.

646
00:53:02.971 --> 00:53:04.178
Wow, wow, wow.

647
00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:07.594
Oh, man.

648
00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:12.479
It's like painted scripture.

649
00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:18.151
What do you think?

650
00:53:19.988 --> 00:53:21.428
It's like another world.

651
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:23.491
Amazing.

652
00:53:24.451 --> 00:53:25.692
Do people just sleep here?

653
00:53:25.786 --> 00:53:29.826
All the younger ones, until we turn 36,
and then we move to the laborers' house.

654
00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:30.915
Why 36?

655
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:33.415
Well, we think of life like the seasons.

656
00:53:33.502 --> 00:53:36.495
So you're a child until you're 18,
and that's spring.

657
00:53:36.588 --> 00:53:38.580
And then at some point
we all do our pilgrimage,

658
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:41.838
which is between 18 and 36,
and that's summer.

659
00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:44.920
And then from 36 to 54,

660
00:53:45.013 --> 00:53:47.005
we're of working age, which is fall.

661
00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:50.722
And then finally from 54 to 72,
you become a mentor.

662
00:53:53.105 --> 00:53:54.516
What happens at 72?

663
00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:00.188
Not a lot of privacy.

664
00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:02.399
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

665
00:54:02.448 --> 00:54:04.884
Especially with all these dicks
on the wall. There's a lot of dicks...

666
00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.900
Oh, wait, no.
We got some pussy paintings too.

667
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:08.735
See, man, that guy dismissed me,

668
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:12.072
but this is exactly like the sakhis saints
and the cult of Aphroditus.

669
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:23.087
Maybe you forgot or something.

670
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:26.045
- It's Dani's birthday today.
- Oh, thank you.

671
00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:31.286
- Did she say something?
- No, no, no, absolutely not.

672
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.677
I just wanted
to let you know before, so...

673
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:35.012
Are these the May queens?

674
00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:37.063
Yeah.

675
00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:40.479
Right.
Uh, you'll actually be here for that.

676
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:43.187
And who are your May queens?

677
00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:46.405
Every midsummer
we have this dance competition,

678
00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:48.074
and the winner gets crowned.

679
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.527
- Oh, wow. Beautiful.
- Hey.

680
00:55:01.173 --> 00:55:02.173
Was that...

681
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.461
You saw that too, right?

682
00:55:06.804 --> 00:55:08.136
Pelle, who was that?

683
00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:11.885
- Inga.
- Oh, my God, I want to give her a bath.

684
00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:14.759
Hey, can I pull you outside for a sec?

685
00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:17.304
Yeah, sure.

686
00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:21.808
Pelle, tell her to come back.

687
00:55:31.453 --> 00:55:33.911

- Stop. It's fine.
- What?

694
00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:56.225
You didn't think I forgot, did you?

695
00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:00.064
I'm sorry.

696
00:56:00.649 --> 00:56:03.253
I'm sorry. I got fucked up by
the daylight. I thought it was yesterday.

697
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:05.421
- It's fine. Thank you.
- Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

698
00:56:05.445 --> 00:56:07.107
I'm not upset. It's okay.

699
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.904
- You should be.
- I should be.

700
00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:10.867
I'm sorry.

701
00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:38.183
All right. Beauty rest.

702
00:56:39.187 --> 00:56:40.394
Tomorrow's a big day.

703
00:56:42.691 --> 00:56:43.691
What's tomorrow?

704
00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:45.895
First of the big ceremonies.

705
00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:51.898
<i>Attestupan.</i>

706
00:56:53.994 --> 00:56:54.994
What's that?

707
00:56:55.454 --> 00:56:59.323
Ah, it's too hard to explain.
You'll get a better sense tomorrow.

708
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:02.079
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

709
00:57:05.047 --> 00:57:07.255
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one.

710
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:09.707
I mean, it's pretty actual.

711
00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:10.882
Fuck.

712
00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:14.678
Do you know what it is?

713
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:19.262
Dude!

714
00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.387
Is it scary?

715
00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:27.775
That is so fucking annoying.

716
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.438
Pelle, check my scalp for ticks,
then I'll check yours.

717
00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:14.487
Somebody should tell those girls
they're walking stupid.

718
00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:24.301
How long do they typically stand?

719
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:27.269
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

720
00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:32.563
Hey. Oh.

721
00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:34.735
- These for me?
- Mm-hmm.

722
00:59:36.281 --> 00:59:37.863
- You pick them backwards?
- Yeah.

723
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:43.547
Are those the ones?

724
01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.099
Yeah.

725
01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.679
Dude, I'm so hungry.
It's like they're trying to make it gross.

726
01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.024
Dude...

727
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:38.063
is the girl from earlier
staring at me again?

728
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.907
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

729
01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:52.282
- Her mother is on pilgrimage.
- Oh.

730
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.741
It helps them to detach.

731
01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:55.294
Okay.

732
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.165
The babies are raised here by everyone.

733
01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.955
Wow. You want this?

734
01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.322
What do you think
that guy's reaction would be

735
01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:12.529
if I just put my finger
in his butt right now?

736
01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.309
Dude, are you following them out?

737
01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.111
I'm beat. I'm gonna go take a nap.

738
01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:11.610
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

739
01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:14.237
Wait. What are we doing now?

740
01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:14.482
What is that book?

741
01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.357
Rubi Radr. Our scripture.

742
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.370
Can I read that?

743
01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:23.699
You would not be able.

744
01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.150
No!

745
01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:18.454
Oh, my God!

746
01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.913
- It's fine. Don't worry.
- Did she jump?

747
01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.574
- What the...
- It's part of the ceremony.

748
01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:30.136
- What? No, she fell, she fell.
- Fuck!

749
01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.468
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

750
01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.266
- It's okay.
- Did she fall or did she jump?

751
01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.143
- She jumped, right?
- It's okay. It's fine.

752
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:40.817
What do you mean it's fine?
She's fucking dead! Look at her head!

753
01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.270
- What the fuck was that?
- Look at her head! She's dead!

754
01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:44.425
It's part of the ceremony.

755
01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:46.218
Why the fuck are you all
standing there like that?

756
01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.154
She just fucking jumped off the cliff.

757
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:51.995
Are you freaking blind? What the fuck?

758
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.076
Oh, my God.

759
01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.412
What the fuck?

760
01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:13.426
- No, no, no.
- No, he's doing the same thing.

761
01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.722
- He's doing the same fucking thing!
- No, no, no.

762
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.431
Someone stop!

763
01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.437
Sir, don't do it. Get him to stop.

764
01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.019
Why's everyone just standing there?
What the fuck!

765
01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:29.280
- Sir, don't jump, don't jump. Get him...
- Someone please do something.

766
01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:31.360
What the fuck? No!

767
01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.429
Fuck! He's still alive!

768
01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.763
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

769
01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:20.416
He's hurt... He's fucking alive!
Call an ambulance!

770
01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.981
Yeah, I'm not going to argue.
Please try to respect it.

771
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.316
- He's alive!
- I'm sorry.

772
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.048
- What do you mean, "respect it"?
- Oh, my God!

773
01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.876
Ah, shit. Fuck, we're going.

774
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.001
Fuck! This is fucked!

775
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.216
Fuck this! You're fucked!

776
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.367
Fuck! You're all just
fucking standing there watching.

777
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.452
What the fuck is wrong with you!

778
01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.604
- No, fucking leave her alone!
- Please, please, please listen to me.

779
01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.210
- What? Explain what?
- Let me explain!

780
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.608
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

781
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.818
What you just saw

782
01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.943
is a long, long, long-observed custom.

783
01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.740
- Custom? It's fucked!
- Yes.

784
01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:38.992
Those two who jumped have just reached
the end of their Hårga life cycle.

785
01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:42.574
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

786
01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.910
- A joy?
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

787
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.329
it will be a great joy for me.

788
01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.337
We view life as a circle.

789
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.462
A recycle.

790
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.882
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

791
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.848
And that baby over there
who is not yet born

792
01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.475
will inherit that name.

793
01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:04.931
Instead of getting old
and dying in pain and fear and shame,

794
01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:07.148
we give our life.

795
01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.692
As a gesture.

796
01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.862
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

797
01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:16.442
It does no good dying,
lashing back at the inevitable.

798
01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.823
It corrupts the spirit.

799
01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:22.535
I am so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

800
01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:28.836
You feeling okay?

801
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.042
I just really need to
not be here right now.

802
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.135
Yeah.

803
01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.682
I'm gonna go.

804
01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.509
Just take some time to yourself, okay?

805
01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:23.245
<i>Number 8...</i>

806
01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:26.637
<i>A businessman in Brussels
was receiving oral sex from his secretary</i>

807
01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.723
<i>in his car while driving on the freeway.</i>

808
01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:32.059
<i>Unfortunately, he needed to make
a sudden stop and was rear-ended,</i>

809
01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:34.645
<i>startling his protégée
into biting down with such...</i>

810
01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:36.025
How was the thing?

811
01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:43.362
<i>...brute force that his penis was severed
clean from his body.</i>

812
01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:45.364
<i>Hope you enjoyed the meal...</i>

813
01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.541
What's up, man?

814
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.420
Are you getting reception here?

815
01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.094
Uh...

816
01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.763
Um, I'll talk to you in...
in just a minute.

817
01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:10.939
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

818
01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.850
Holy shit, right?

819
01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:15.779
Are you okay?

820
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:17.781
Yeah, I'm fine.

821
01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:19.699
Good.

822
01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.034
Hey, listen. Um...

823
01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:31.118
I've been thinking about something
that I wanted to ask you.

824
01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.999
Or tell you, actually.

825
01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:35.715
Um...

826
01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:42.300
I've been thinking a lot about my thesis,

827
01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:47.225
and, um, I've decided
I'm going to do it here, on Hårga.

828
01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:53.436
And I wanted to tell you first, just so
it didn't seem like I wasn't telling you.

829
01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:59.484
I feel like...
I feel like I can't tell if you're joking.

830
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.954
I mean, you know
I'm doing my thesis on midsummer.

831
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.827
- That's the reason why I'm here.
- Yeah.

832
01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.751
Yeah, but not on this community.

833
01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:17.005
I mean, you're going to Germany
and England next.

834
01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:21.509
Well, you knew
I was gonna want to do this.

835
01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:25.593
- No.
- Oh, my God.

836
01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:28.036
- I mean, did you even know until just now?
- Christian, of course you did.

837
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.019
Okay, do you think
I don't know what you're doing?

838
01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.814
It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

839
01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.517
The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

840
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.728
I'm honestly kind of impressed.

841
01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:43.218
- What the fuck, man? What does that mean?
- Yeah, what the fuck!

842
01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.609
This is what I've been working toward,
and you know it.

843
01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:48.431
That's why you look so guilty right now...
because you know.

844
01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:51.914
You know that what you're doing
is unethical and leechy and lazy,

845
01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.742
and frankly it's kind of sad.

846
01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:57.295
- Fuck you.
- No, dude, not fuck me.

847
01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.499
Find your own subject.
Or-Or your own passion.

848
01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.334
And... Because... All right, look.

849
01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:05.592
This... I am...
I am actually invested in this.

850
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:10.384
This is not some glorified hobby
that I'm casually dipping my feet into.

851
01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:11.477
Okay.

852
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.312
In case you hadn't noticed, Your Highness,

853
01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:16.105
we're doing the exact same degree.

854
01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.400
No, but not in the same way, Christian!

855
01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:22.775
Okay? I have to hold your little hand
through everything.

856
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:26.529
You didn't even know how to use JSTOR
until I taught you,

857
01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:28.702
and you are a fucking grad student.

858
01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.619
Why are you even in academia?

859
01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:34.332
You don't care! Which is fine.
That is your prerogative.

860
01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:38.207
But do not appropriate my actual work
for your new shortcut.

861
01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.546
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

862
01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:51.424
If you're going to do it here too,
I'm open to collaborating.

863
01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:56.430
And if not, I guess we can both do
separate theses on the Hårgas.

864
01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:06.319
Dude,
of all the things to let me sleep through.

865
01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.408
What?

866
01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:20.935
- We're leaving tomorrow morning.
- I know we are.

867
01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:31.465
Sorry, um...
Hi. I don't mean to disturb you...

868
01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:32.969
Uh...

869
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.060
Hello.

870
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.886
Hi, I'm Christian.

871
01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:45.229
Hello. My name is Ulla.

872
01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:48.190
- Ulla.
- Ulla. And this is Maja.

873
01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.820
- Maja, hi.
- Hmm...

874
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.202
What are you guys doing?

875
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.747
We are decorating the tree.

876
01:19:57.042 --> 01:20:00.626
Right. Um, I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

877
01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.420
- Of course.
- How many... uh...

878
01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:07.380
How many times have you seen
<i>Attestupan...</i> performed?

879
01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.085
<i>- "Attestupan."
- "Attestupan."</i>

880
01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:11.032
How many times you've seen it performed?

881
01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.592
Oh... uh...

882
01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:16.218
Every time one reaches age, so...

883
01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:18.519
- Okay.
- A lot.

884
01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.308
Okay.

885
01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:24.484
And do you have a typical...
period of grieving?

886
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.438
Is there a-a time when you mourn?

887
01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:32.447
Mm-hmm. We grieve and celebrate.

888
01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.699
- Yes.
- Okay. I see.

889
01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:37.868
I told Christian this already,

890
01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.894
and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea.

891
01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.771
- So if he comes up to you...
- Well, no. Wait a minute.

892
01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:45.584
I seriously doubt the elders will approve
of anything being written down.

893
01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.834
They're extremely protective.

894
01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:49.195
So then I'll just use aliases
for everything. Problem solved.

895
01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:52.007
Then what would be the point?
You couldn't even get it peer-reviewed.

896
01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.057
And Christian did already ask me this,
by the way.

897
01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.182
And I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

898
01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.226
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

899
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.804
Ah, fuck. No.

900
01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:03.982
Okay, look, I'll ask the elders.
Okay? Good?

901
01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.038
Dani?

902
01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:19.749
Um...

903
01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:22.951
I'm really sorry, Pelle. Thank you
for inviting me, but I really have to go.

904
01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.707
Can someone maybe drive me somewhere?

905
01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.709
I know I shouldn't have let you
stay for that.

906
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.711
I mean, I know it looks extreme.

907
01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:31.544
- But we only...
- I don't know why I'm here, Pelle!

908
01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:34.129
I don't know why you invited us.
I don't know why...

909
01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.742
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay.

910
01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.535
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know, and I can't...

911
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.471
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

912
01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.678
Dani, please. Please, sit down.

913
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440
Dani.

914
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.736
I invited my friends because
this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

915
01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.108
and I wanted to share it,

916
01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:54.316
especially with my friends
who I knew would appreciate it.

917
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.196
Because I...

918
01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:57.652
- I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

919
01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:00.475
Okay, but I'm not an anthropologist,
and I don't understand any of this.

920
01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.352
- Yes, yes, yes. I know, I know.
- I don't get it.

921
01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:05.119
And yet,
I was the most excited for you to come.

922
01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:09.335
Here. Here, smell this.

923
01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:12.427
What is it?

924
01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.386
- It calms you down.
- No. I'm fine. I don't want it.

925
01:22:18.058 --> 01:22:20.425
- Are you sure?
- No, I-I really want to go, Pelle.

926
01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.852
- I don't... I don't want it.
- Okay.

927
01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.097
I know what you're going through, Dani.

928
01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:29.392
What am I going through?

929
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.902
- Because I lost my parents too.
- What?

930
01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:35.027
No, no, Pelle.
That is not what I'm talking about.

931
01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.095
- I'm not talking about my family.
- I know you're not.

932
01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:38.972
- I'm talking about...
- I lost my parents as I was a little boy.

933
01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:41.784
- They burned up in a fire.
- No, I wasn't talking about that.

934
01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:48.249
My parents, they burned up in a fire,
and I became technically an orphan.

935
01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.790
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

936
01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:54.251
Because I do. I really, really do.

937
01:22:57.556 --> 01:23:00.549
Yet my difference is,
I never got the chance to feel lost

938
01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.601
because I had a family... here,

939
01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:08.432
where everyone embraced me
and swept me up.

940
01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:12.937
And I was raised by a community
that doesn't bicker over

941
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.647
what's theirs and what's not theirs.

942
01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.316
That's what you were given.

943
01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:21.736
But I have always felt held.

944
01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.122
By a family. A real family...

945
01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.050
which everyone deserves.

946
01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:39.382
And you deserve.

947
01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:48.479
Pelle, Christian could walk in.

948
01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:49.851
He's what I'm talking about.

949
01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:55.278
He's my good friend,
and I like him, but...

950
01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.857
Dani, do you feel held by him?

951
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:03.786
Does he feel like home to you?

952
01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:47.200
Hey. How you doing?

953
01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.078
Today was tough.

954
01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.916
Are you going to be okay?

955
01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.876
Are you not disturbed by what we just saw?

956
01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.253
Yeah, of course I am.

957
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.927
That was really, really shocking.

958
01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:09.893
I'm trying to keep an open mind though.

959
01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.522
That's cultural, you know?

960
01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.732
We stick our elders in nursing homes.
I'm sure they find that disturbing.

961
01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:23.618
Hello.

962
01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:28.121
Would you like to be joining us
with a special ceremony?

963
01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.082
Why? What's happening now?

964
01:27:58.732 --> 01:27:59.848
What's happening?

965
01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.281
What's happening?

966
01:28:13.872 --> 01:28:15.158
No, wait, wait. Stop!

967
01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:56.704
Okay, can you slow down?
Just wait a sec, babe.

968
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:59.908
Please, Christian,
this is feeling really wrong.

969
01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.367
We need to leave.

970
01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:04.378
I know that this is weird,

971
01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:05.858
- but it's because it's alien.
- No...

972
01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.295
We haven't been exposed
to anything like this.

973
01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:11.423
No, Christian. This is completely
backwards. We need to leave.

974
01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:14.313
- We just need to acclimate.
- I don't want to acclimate. I want to go.

975
01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:17.008
Well, I can't. I'm sorry. Period.

976
01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:20.261
I'm doing my thesis on this.

977
01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.766
What? Since when?

978
01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:24.728
Since I decided today.

979
01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:28.249
You know how much of a nightmare
this has been for me to figure out.

980
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.008
And I've made the mistake of telling Josh,
and now he's competing with me.

981
01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:34.150
So if he wants it, let him have it.
We need to leave.

982
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:39.364
Can you not see what's going on here?
This level of tradition?

983
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.913
No one's seen this.
No one's written anything on it.

984
01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.960
And they've invited us to be a part of it.

985
01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.766
- Can't you see what a privilege that is?
- Why have they invited us?

986
01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.832
- Because Pelle did.
- Why did Pelle?

987
01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:52.339
- Because he trusts us.
- Why would they trust us?

988
01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.679
You're opportunistic
anthropology students.

989
01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.677
Maybe because we're anthropology students.

990
01:29:57.767 --> 01:29:58.828
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe they want

991
01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:00.892
- someone to document this.
- Are you fucking blind?

992
01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:04.973
They're doing pagan rituals.
People are jumping off cliffs.

993
01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:07.729
They depend
on no one knowing about this ever.

994
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:09.686
Not necessarily.

995
01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:14.570
Okay. I want to leave.

996
01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:19.905
Okay, then you can leave. But I'm staying.

997
01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:24.784
I invited you, and I don't regret that,
but I'm here for a reason.

998
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:33.921
Do you not love me anymore?

999
01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:44.102
What does that have to do with this?

1000
01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:46.730
We're in the devaluation phase.

1001
01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:49.684
We've been in it for a long time,
and next comes discard.

1002
01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:53.863
Can we spare our relationship
your textbook psychology keywords?

1003
01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.362
We've been in this for a while.

1004
01:30:56.826 --> 01:30:59.364
You've been trying to pull away,
and I've been in denial.

1005
01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.744
Please. Give yourself some credit, babe.

1006
01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:11.964
Looks like
you've got this all figured out.

1007
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:14.007
What?

1008
01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.508
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna say one thing.

1009
01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:24.807
When you casually gift me
an impromptu bouquet of flowers,

1010
01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:26.457
- that just makes me think...
- What flowers?

1011
01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.689
...how and when
am I supposed to pay that back?

1012
01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:31.267
Everything you give me is a reminder

1013
01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:33.853
that I'm not doing enough for you
in this relationship.

1014
01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:35.980
What, at lunch?

1015
01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:39.234
I picked those on a whim!

1016
01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.819
Oh, don't try to tell me
that you had no ulterior motive.

1017
01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:43.766
- Yeah! What motives do I have?
- On your birthday?

1018
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:46.328
The day after I didn't get you something?

1019
01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:49.497
Are you being serious?

1020
01:31:52.465 --> 01:31:53.546
Okay, fine.

1021
01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.841
Play the wounded party again.

1022
01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.088
You're just a self-denying altruist,
and I'm a paranoid dick.

1023
01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:02.138
You don't have a conniving bone
in your body.

1024
01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:05.184
- What is it you imagine I'm conniving?
- You are, Dani!

1025
01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:09.063
I feel locked into your debt every time
you do something "just because."

1026
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:11.752
- I don't keep you in my debt!
- Because it's never "just because."

1027
01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:13.142
I was being kind.

1028
01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:14.693
Okay, fine. I'm the asshole.

1029
01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.066
- Nobody's the asshole.
- I clearly am.

1030
01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:22.118
You selflessly gave me flowers,
and I feel trapped. Fuck!

1031
01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.865
Are you actually gonna leave?

1032
01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:27.160
- I'm supposed to be working here.
- You're gonna leave me like this?

1033
01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:29.579
Christian!

1034
01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:43.718
Hey, do you... Sorry.

1035
01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:46.429
Do you have a sleeping pill I can take?

1036
01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.385
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

1037
01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:16.922
Shh.
You're going to wake her up.

1038
01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:20.184
Yo, Pelle!

1039
01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:36.832
Whatcha doin'?

1040
01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.037
Just working in the garden.

1041
01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:47.208
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1042
01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:49.052
Any word?

1043
01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:51.883
Yeah. They say you can do it.

1044
01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:54.465
As long as you absolutely
don't use any names or...

1045
01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:56.846
- Okay. Wow.
- ...the location is never even hinted at.

1046
01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:57.936
Okay.

1047
01:36:58.021 --> 01:36:59.933
And you'll have to sign
an agreement to that.

1048
01:37:01.107 --> 01:37:04.271
And you're splitting it with Christian
because he came to me first.

1049
01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:08.229
Well, that's... We'll figure that out.

1050
01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:09.530
I got to go take a leak.

1051
01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:12.153
Uh, here, can I ask you something?

1052
01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:13.359
Yeah.

1053
01:37:13.453 --> 01:37:16.070
Do you know what this is?

1054
01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:19.205
I found it under Christian's bed.

1055
01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:24.329
Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

1056
01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:26.042
A love rune.

1057
01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:27.132
Yeah.

1058
01:37:27.884 --> 01:37:29.466
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

1059
01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:33.428
What's going on?

1060
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.506
Uh, the elders said you can do your thesis

1061
01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:39.184
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

1062
01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:41.179
Are you serious?

1063
01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:42.272
Yeah.

1064
01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:47.269
Oh, my God. Thank you, man.
That is incredible news. Thank you.

1065
01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:49.194
Great.
You're splitting it with Josh as well.

1066
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.522
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

1067
01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:55.784
Good. Well, I think my sister, Maja,
has taken a liking to you.

1068
01:37:57.622 --> 01:37:58.783
- Yeah?
- Yep.

1069
01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:00.624
The redhead?

1070
01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:04.751
And actually she just got
<i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

1071
01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:12.423
It basically means that you are allowed
to have sex when you're 15. Pan's license.

1072
01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:15.839
Okay, good for her.

1073
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:22.270
Hey, whoa!

1074
01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:26.474
What? Okay, relax, relax. What did I do?

1075
01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:30.352
- Pelle, what is going on?
- What happened?

1076
01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:36.233
What did I do? What did I do wrong?

1077
01:38:38.204 --> 01:38:40.491
Dude, okay! Relax!

1078
01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.447
You pissed on the ancestral tree.

1079
01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:43.783
- The tree? So what?
- Yes, yes.

1080
01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:44.876
"So what"!

1081
01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:47.453
- I didn't know.
- No, it's...

1082
01:38:47.547 --> 01:38:49.630
That tree is tied to all of our dead.

1083
01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:52.924
It's a dead tree though. It's dead.

1084
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:54.922
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But it's important to us.

1085
01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:57.174
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

1086
01:38:57.265 --> 01:39:00.258
No, I know. We know that
you didn't know that, but it's just...

1087
01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:03.560
- Well, how was I supposed to know...
- You wouldn't pee on a gravestone, right?

1088
01:39:03.646 --> 01:39:05.057
Obviously not, but...

1089
01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:09.934
- Fuck! I mean...
- What did you do to him?

1090
01:39:10.027 --> 01:39:12.227
I don't know what I'm apologizing for...
Do I apologize?

1091
01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:14.614
Apologize later.

1092
01:39:16.159 --> 01:39:17.775
- Okay.
- Oh, shit. Hi.

1093
01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:26.956
- Okay.
- What the fuck!

1094
01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:33.377
What did she say?

1095
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.218
She said it's gonna be okay,

1096
01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:39.843
and she'll talk to Ulf
and apologize for the mistake.

1097
01:39:39.932 --> 01:39:42.345
Seriously? What else did she say?

1098
01:39:54.614 --> 01:39:55.614
Hey.

1099
01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:56.779
Hi.

1100
01:39:57.492 --> 01:39:58.949
You get some good sleep?

1101
01:39:59.535 --> 01:40:00.535
Mm-hmm.

1102
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:02.370
Good.

1103
01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:04.746
What happened over there?

1104
01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:07.623
Mark's... just...

1105
01:40:23.226 --> 01:40:24.683
I'm sorry about last night.

1106
01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:26.802
How are you feeling?

1107
01:40:30.983 --> 01:40:32.815
I don't want us to be fighting, Christian.

1108
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:35.070
Well...

1109
01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:37.696
me neither.

1110
01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:10.513
Hey.

1111
01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.643
Hey. It was really nice to meet you.

1112
01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:15.191
I'm so sorry. We're actually leaving.

1113
01:41:15.278 --> 01:41:16.278
What?

1114
01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.399
- Yeah.
- Connie.

1115
01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:20.634
Simon is getting the truck
with one of them now.

1116
01:41:20.658 --> 01:41:22.320
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

1117
01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.120
Connie.

1118
01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:27.289
Oh, there.

1119
01:41:28.124 --> 01:41:33.461
Uh, Simon, he told me to tell you
that Jan drove him to the train station.

1120
01:41:33.546 --> 01:41:38.507
And after Simon gets dropped off,
he's sending the truck back for you.

1121
01:41:38.593 --> 01:41:39.593
What?

1122
01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:42.211
You will meet him there.

1123
01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:47.132
No. Why would he just go without me?
He wouldn't do that.

1124
01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:50.135
Well, the truck only had room for two.

1125
01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:54.357
What does that mean?

1126
01:41:55.234 --> 01:41:57.442
That doesn't even make any sense.
He would have told me.

1127
01:41:58.029 --> 01:42:00.362
Today's only train leaves in 90 minutes.

1128
01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:02.781
It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

1129
01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:04.403
So they didn't want to waste time.

1130
01:42:05.745 --> 01:42:07.327
So I could have sat on his lap.

1131
01:42:07.413 --> 01:42:12.704
Yes, I imagine that too, but, you know,
we don't break traffic laws, okay?

1132
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.292
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

1133
01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:21.125
Now, Connie,
there was no room in the truck.

1134
01:42:21.218 --> 01:42:24.461
Yet it is coming right back for you. Yeah?

1135
01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.059
This is bullshit.

1136
01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:40.689
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1137
01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:03.675
And how are... jobs or roles assigned?

1138
01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.424
That's based on traits we show as kids.

1139
01:43:07.932 --> 01:43:11.300
For example, he was assigned to protect.

1140
01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:13.431
So he made his pilgrimage as doctor.

1141
01:43:15.398 --> 01:43:16.639
Is he gonna be okay?

1142
01:43:17.525 --> 01:43:19.391
I mean...

1143
01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:22.193
Yeah, he's a very sensitive guy.

1144
01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:24.188
It's a big week for him.

1145
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.107
- Hey.
- Hi. Sorry.

1146
01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:31.157
Um, Simon left without Connie.

1147
01:43:32.498 --> 01:43:33.534
Jesus, really?

1148
01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:35.456
- Yeah.
- What a dick move.

1149
01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:39.036
- Is she okay?
- Uh, no.

1150
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:40.357
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

1151
01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:41.381
No, no.

1152
01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:43.882
That sucks.

1153
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:49.134
On the... On the subject
of couples, actually, um...

1154
01:43:51.016 --> 01:43:53.474
is there ever an issue here with incest?

1155
01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.347
Sorry. I mean, you know...
small communities.

1156
01:43:59.358 --> 01:44:02.851
Well, the bloodlines
are very well preserved.

1157
01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:04.652
So the elders must approve mates.

1158
01:44:05.531 --> 01:44:10.697
Cousins can sometimes mate.
But we do respect the incest taboo.

1159
01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:13.369
So we often need to...

1160
01:44:14.665 --> 01:44:16.782
We often need to invite outside peoples.

1161
01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:38.303
Excuse me. Hey.

1162
01:44:39.648 --> 01:44:41.264
Would you like to help join us?

1163
01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:44.444
Uh...

1164
01:44:45.571 --> 01:44:46.571
sure, yeah.

1165
01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:47.655
Come.

1166
01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:52.780
Do you... Do you know, um...
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1167
01:44:53.579 --> 01:44:57.243
Yes. He was driven to the station.
Did you not say good-bye?

1168
01:44:57.833 --> 01:45:02.123
No. No, I didn't.
But, uh, that's okay, that's okay.

1169
01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:03.880
Hi.

1170
01:45:08.844 --> 01:45:09.960
What are we making here?

1171
01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:11.507
Meat tarts.

1172
01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:13.348
Oh, wow.

1173
01:45:14.225 --> 01:45:15.261
Oh, thank you.

1174
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:19.852
She says you're so beautiful.

1175
01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:22.639
Oh, thank you.

1176
01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:24.770
Um, she's so beautiful.

1177
01:45:44.046 --> 01:45:47.756
We describe it like emotional sheet music.

1178
01:45:48.217 --> 01:45:49.217
What does it say?

1179
01:45:49.718 --> 01:45:55.259
Well, each runic letter stands for
one of the 16 <i>affekts,</i>

1180
01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:58.433
which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

1181
01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:01.557
This one, for example, is about grief.

1182
01:46:02.648 --> 01:46:06.813
You can see at the end, however,
we have blank pages.

1183
01:46:07.945 --> 01:46:12.940
This is because the Rubi Radr is a work
forever in progress.

1184
01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:16.822
Forever evolving.
We have many, many hundreds of these.

1185
01:46:18.539 --> 01:46:21.577
And who decides what gets added?

1186
01:46:22.334 --> 01:46:26.544
Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Ruben.

1187
01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:32.543
Uh, the disabled...

1188
01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:34.510
Since birth.

1189
01:46:35.431 --> 01:46:38.674
He draws, and we the Elders interpret.

1190
01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:44.688
You see, Josh,
Ruben is unclouded by normal cognition.

1191
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:48.184
It makes him open for the source.

1192
01:46:48.861 --> 01:46:55.324
Uh... what happens when Ruben... dies?

1193
01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:58.117
Do you just wait for a baby that is...

1194
01:47:00.247 --> 01:47:01.454
not clouded?

1195
01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:06.205
No, no, no.
Ruben was a product of inbreeding.

1196
01:47:06.795 --> 01:47:10.539
All of our oracles
are deliberate products of inbreeding.

1197
01:47:14.428 --> 01:47:15.669
Can I take a photograph?

1198
01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:18.348
What?

1199
01:47:18.849 --> 01:47:20.181
Uh, a photograph?

1200
01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:21.267
No.

1201
01:47:21.352 --> 01:47:23.469
- Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

1202
01:47:24.063 --> 01:47:26.180
Absolutely not.

1203
01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:52.960
Oh, fuck. Yep, that's her.

1204
01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:01.724
Hey.

1205
01:48:09.566 --> 01:48:11.182
Oh. Great. She's walking away.

1206
01:48:31.922 --> 01:48:32.922
Thank you.

1207
01:48:40.097 --> 01:48:41.133
Thanks.

1208
01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:42.223
<i>Tack.</i>

1209
01:48:42.766 --> 01:48:43.766
Thanks.

1210
01:48:49.982 --> 01:48:51.314
Has anyone seen Connie?

1211
01:48:53.861 --> 01:48:55.272
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1212
01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:59.443
I'm sure I saw her trying out
for the sprinting Olympics earlier.

1213
01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:02.150
- What? Where?
- Sorry, but I can say what happened.

1214
01:49:02.828 --> 01:49:04.931
Her boyfriend called
the landline from the train station

1215
01:49:04.955 --> 01:49:06.162
and calmed Connie down.

1216
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:09.203
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

1217
01:49:12.755 --> 01:49:16.123
- Okay. Well, that's a relief.
- Why would Simon leave without her?

1218
01:49:17.968 --> 01:49:19.709
I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1219
01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:39.062
I could see you possibly doing that.

1220
01:49:44.578 --> 01:49:45.989
What the hell does that mean?

1221
01:49:52.294 --> 01:49:53.294
Never mind.

1222
01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:03.090
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

1223
01:50:09.228 --> 01:50:10.639
Dude, is he gonna kill me?

1224
01:50:14.066 --> 01:50:15.932
Did you learn anything
about the Rubi Radr?

1225
01:50:22.658 --> 01:50:24.115
Oh, so now you want to collaborate?

1226
01:50:24.201 --> 01:50:25.362
Okay, thank you.

1227
01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:26.971
- I know that one elder...
- Thank you.

1228
01:50:26.995 --> 01:50:29.595
- ...gave you a glimpse of it.
- Thank you. Sorry I brought it up.

1229
01:50:53.605 --> 01:50:55.597
Oh, my God, dude. What the fuck?

1230
01:50:56.733 --> 01:50:58.395
- Is that...
- What is that?

1231
01:50:58.485 --> 01:51:00.021
Is that a fucking pube?

1232
01:51:00.112 --> 01:51:01.478
- Ew.
- It's just a hair.

1233
01:51:01.572 --> 01:51:02.779
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1234
01:51:03.574 --> 01:51:05.361
Dude, calm down.

1235
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:09.160
Why are you embarrassed? You're not
the one giving out... hair pies.

1236
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:31.428
Jesus Christ.
He's still fucking lookin' at me.

1237
01:51:32.102 --> 01:51:34.344
Hey. You'll come with me?

1238
01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:37.438
- What?
- You'll come?

1239
01:51:38.317 --> 01:51:39.524
- Uh...
- I'll show you.

1240
01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:41.651
Okay, sure.

1241
01:51:41.737 --> 01:51:43.979
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

1242
01:51:44.072 --> 01:51:47.907
Um, I'll be back.
I guess she's going to show me.

1243
01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:13.508
Hey, can I, uh, borrow
another sleeping pill?

1244
01:52:13.602 --> 01:52:15.093
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

1245
01:52:18.023 --> 01:52:19.023
Thank you.

1246
01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.041
What the fuck, Mark?

1247
01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:13.757
What the fuck are you doing? Close the
door! We're not supposed to be in here.

1248
01:55:11.279 --> 01:55:13.236
Do you think
Mark's still off with that girl?

1249
01:55:14.408 --> 01:55:15.649
I wouldn't be surprised.

1250
01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:20.411
What about Josh, though?

1251
01:55:20.497 --> 01:55:22.284
I'm honestly not too concerned.

1252
01:55:24.042 --> 01:55:25.042
Wow.

1253
01:55:26.086 --> 01:55:31.206
We, um... have something regretful
to announce.

1254
01:55:31.967 --> 01:55:37.804
This morning the 19th Book of Rubi Radr
was found missing from the temple.

1255
01:55:39.349 --> 01:55:41.807
We don't want to point fingers,

1256
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:46.645
yet we kindly ask that whoever took it
to return it to its original place.

1257
01:55:46.731 --> 01:55:48.472
You can leave it in the temple,

1258
01:55:48.567 --> 01:55:50.684
which will be left unguarded
and unwatched.

1259
01:55:51.528 --> 01:55:54.236
Nobody needs to know it was you.

1260
01:56:07.335 --> 01:56:08.792
Where is your friend, Josh?

1261
01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:11.917
I know. Uh, we have no idea.

1262
01:56:12.591 --> 01:56:17.427
He and your other friend,
they both disappears the same day.

1263
01:56:19.222 --> 01:56:20.222
You see how it looks?

1264
01:56:20.307 --> 01:56:23.391
Yes, obviously. But I swear to you
we are in the dark on this.

1265
01:56:23.477 --> 01:56:25.093
We're just as confused as you are.

1266
01:56:26.897 --> 01:56:29.264
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

1267
01:56:30.192 --> 01:56:31.683
- What girl?
- Inga.

1268
01:56:32.235 --> 01:56:33.851
Yeah, but Mark wouldn't have done this.

1269
01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:35.152
Josh, on the other hand...

1270
01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:38.238
he came to bed with us,
and when we woke up he was gone.

1271
01:56:38.325 --> 01:56:41.033
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

1272
01:56:41.119 --> 01:56:45.454
we don't associate as friends of his
or collaborators or anything.

1273
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.953
We would just be so embarrassed
to be connected to this

1274
01:56:48.043 --> 01:56:49.409
in any way, shape or form.

1275
01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:53.918
Let's hope it gets returned.

1276
01:56:54.799 --> 01:56:55.915
I hope so too.

1277
01:56:56.009 --> 01:56:57.295
I feel responsible.

1278
01:56:58.053 --> 01:57:00.921
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1279
01:57:01.014 --> 01:57:02.926
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1280
01:57:05.018 --> 01:57:08.511
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1281
01:57:08.605 --> 01:57:10.016
Oh, hi.

1282
01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:12.940
And Siv wants to see you in her house.

1283
01:57:20.825 --> 01:57:22.191
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1284
01:57:23.119 --> 01:57:24.119
Okay.

1285
01:57:25.789 --> 01:57:26.789
Okay.

1286
01:58:08.164 --> 01:58:09.371
This is the big one.

1287
01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:12.283
Okay. Thank you.

1288
01:58:16.131 --> 01:58:17.622
Look into her eyes.

1289
01:58:17.716 --> 01:58:18.716
Mm-hmm.

1290
01:58:19.509 --> 01:58:22.217
Um... can I ask what this is exactly?

1291
01:58:23.179 --> 01:58:26.263
It's, uh... tea for the competition.

1292
01:58:32.397 --> 01:58:35.686
- And then you... glass here.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
01:58:37.652 --> 01:58:39.109
And then we drink it.

1294
01:58:39.195 --> 01:58:40.436
- Okay?
- Okay.

1295
01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:42.781
Okay.

1296
01:58:47.454 --> 01:58:48.454
Mm-hmm?

1297
01:58:49.748 --> 01:58:50.989
Uh-oh!

1298
01:58:51.082 --> 01:58:52.664
- Oh, God.
- Here we go.

1299
02:00:55.582 --> 02:00:56.823
Please. Come in.

1300
02:01:50.428 --> 02:01:54.172
Firstly, I just have to say
I have no idea where Josh is.

1301
02:01:54.265 --> 02:01:56.427
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1302
02:01:56.518 --> 02:01:58.100
How do you feel about Maja?

1303
02:02:03.066 --> 02:02:04.352
About Maja?

1304
02:02:10.657 --> 02:02:12.398
How do I feel about her how?

1305
02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:14.988
You have been approved to mate with her.

1306
02:02:15.912 --> 02:02:18.950
You're an ideal astrological match.

1307
02:02:19.999 --> 02:02:22.082
And she has fixed her hopes on you.

1308
02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:27.879
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

1309
02:02:30.552 --> 02:02:32.464
I haven't even spoken to her.

1310
02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:35.387
She fixed on you before you came.

1311
02:02:36.224 --> 02:02:38.341
Pelle showed her a photo.

1312
02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:47.767
I'm here with someone.

1313
02:02:48.653 --> 02:02:49.689
I'm here with Dani.

1314
02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.441
Dani will not know.

1315
02:02:53.408 --> 02:02:55.365
I am not proposing marriage.

1316
02:02:56.661 --> 02:02:58.402
You wouldn't be approved for that.

1317
02:03:01.374 --> 02:03:03.616
Okay, so what is it you're asking?

1318
02:03:05.086 --> 02:03:08.124
I'm asking if you care to mate with Maja.

1319
02:03:08.882 --> 02:03:10.339
It's a one-night offer.

1320
02:03:18.808 --> 02:03:21.095
I think I ate one of her pubic hairs.

1321
02:03:21.185 --> 02:03:23.051
Oh. Sounds probably right.

1322
02:03:25.523 --> 02:03:27.230
From an academic perspective...

1323
02:03:27.859 --> 02:03:32.149
it would also provide a unique glimpse
into our sexual rites.

1324
02:03:39.037 --> 02:03:41.825
Can I not have a unique glimpse
without participating?

1325
02:04:33.633 --> 02:04:34.794
- Stay here.
- What?

1326
02:04:35.718 --> 02:04:36.718
Are you ready?

1327
02:04:37.595 --> 02:04:39.257
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1328
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:57.877
- You're so good.
- What does that mean?

1329
02:05:57.967 --> 02:05:59.458
- Eight, eight!
- What?

1330
02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:00.963
We're now eight left!

1331
02:06:24.035 --> 02:06:25.822
Christian?

1332
02:06:25.912 --> 02:06:27.653
Um, for you?

1333
02:06:27.747 --> 02:06:28.747
Uh...

1334
02:06:30.083 --> 02:06:31.915
Thanks.

1335
02:06:32.668 --> 02:06:34.250
- What is it?
- Um, it's...

1336
02:06:34.879 --> 02:06:36.290
Sorry.

1337
02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:42.176
Spring water with special properties.

1338
02:06:43.054 --> 02:06:44.054
Oh.

1339
02:06:45.848 --> 02:06:46.848
Okay.

1340
02:06:48.476 --> 02:06:49.717
What does it do?

1341
02:06:49.811 --> 02:06:50.811
Oh, um...

1342
02:06:51.604 --> 02:06:55.393
It breaks down your defenses

1343
02:06:55.483 --> 02:06:58.976
and opens you for the influence.

1344
02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:01.363
Okay.

1345
02:07:03.116 --> 02:07:04.152
Thanks.

1346
02:07:05.118 --> 02:07:06.118
You're welcome.

1347
02:07:07.745 --> 02:07:08.781
You know what? Um...

1348
02:07:09.872 --> 02:07:11.454
I'm worried I'll have a bad trip.

1349
02:07:11.541 --> 02:07:14.079
Oh, no. You won't. You won't. Trust me.

1350
02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:00.055
I don't speak Swedish.

1351
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:01.515
What?

1352
02:09:22.964 --> 02:09:23.964
Aah!

1353
02:09:40.564 --> 02:09:41.680
What's happening?

1354
02:09:44.235 --> 02:09:47.273
You are our May queen.

1355
02:09:48.197 --> 02:09:49.438
- Me?
- Yes.

1356
02:09:49.532 --> 02:09:50.989
- Why?
- You won!

1357
02:09:52.702 --> 02:09:53.909
What does that mean?

1358
02:09:54.996 --> 02:09:55.996
Oh, my God.

1359
02:10:45.421 --> 02:10:47.253
Mom? Mom?

1360
02:10:49.258 --> 02:10:52.217
Oh, my God, Dani! May queen!

1361
02:13:30.252 --> 02:13:31.252
Herring?

1362
02:13:32.046 --> 02:13:33.082
What for?

1363
02:13:34.507 --> 02:13:36.214
It's tradition. For good luck.

1364
02:13:36.967 --> 02:13:37.967
Yeah!

1365
02:13:38.552 --> 02:13:39.552
What?

1366
02:13:39.637 --> 02:13:41.253
And you must eat it whole.

1367
02:13:41.347 --> 02:13:43.464
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no.

1368
02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:47.221
You must try! You must try!

1369
02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:51.429
Aww.

1370
02:13:58.113 --> 02:14:00.230
A very good try.

1371
02:14:03.369 --> 02:14:04.655
Excuse me?

1372
02:14:05.829 --> 02:14:06.829
What's going on?

1373
02:14:16.507 --> 02:14:17.793
Why did you do that?

1374
02:14:25.057 --> 02:14:26.844
To our May queen!

1375
02:14:28.394 --> 02:14:30.306
<i>Välkommen! Skål!</i>

1376
02:14:30.396 --> 02:14:32.262
<i>Skål!</i>

1377
02:14:44.285 --> 02:14:45.867
You are in the family now. Yes?

1378
02:14:46.704 --> 02:14:48.195
Yes, you are in the family.

1379
02:14:49.081 --> 02:14:50.081
Like sisters.

1380
02:16:24.927 --> 02:16:29.922
Now it's traditional for the May queen
to bless our crops and livestock.

1381
02:16:31.725 --> 02:16:35.685
And after the luck you just inherited
from that salt herring,

1382
02:16:35.771 --> 02:16:38.388
we should all be doubly encouraged.

1383
02:16:51.954 --> 02:16:53.411
Can Christian come with me?

1384
02:16:54.415 --> 02:16:55.622
Nay.

1385
02:16:55.708 --> 02:16:57.040
The queen must ride alone.

1386
02:19:54.803 --> 02:19:56.169
So repeat after me?

1387
02:20:42.726 --> 02:20:43.726
Breathe in.

1388
02:20:47.064 --> 02:20:48.600
For your vitality.

1389
02:25:16.917 --> 02:25:18.658
We shall go now to Siv's house.

1390
02:25:19.461 --> 02:25:20.668
What's this?

1391
02:25:20.754 --> 02:25:23.167
It's a special meeting,
only for the queens.

1392
02:25:23.798 --> 02:25:25.209
She will bless you.

1393
02:25:29.054 --> 02:25:30.295
What's that?

1394
02:25:30.388 --> 02:25:31.504
That's not for us.

1395
02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:38.636
I think you should not.

1396
02:27:28.089 --> 02:27:29.330
No, no, no.

1397
02:32:33.603 --> 02:32:34.603
Christian?

1398
02:32:36.689 --> 02:32:37.689
Christian.

1399
02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:41.818
Hi.

1400
02:32:43.446 --> 02:32:45.062
Hello. There you are.

1401
02:32:45.948 --> 02:32:50.443
Listen. You can't speak. You can't move.

1402
02:32:51.704 --> 02:32:52.704
All right?

1403
02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:54.831
Good.

1404
02:33:05.218 --> 02:33:10.259
On this,
the day of our deity of reciprocity,

1405
02:33:10.348 --> 02:33:15.013
we gather to give special thanks
to our treasured sun.

1406
02:33:15.978 --> 02:33:22.600
As an offering to our father,
we will today surrender nine human lives.

1407
02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:27.817
As Hårga takes, so Hårga also gives.

1408
02:33:28.616 --> 02:33:32.906
Thus, for every new blood sacrificed,

1409
02:33:33.371 --> 02:33:36.535
we will dedicate one of our own.

1410
02:33:37.917 --> 02:33:43.083
That is four new bloods. Four from Hårga.

1411
02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:47.083
And one to be chosen by the queen.

1412
02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:50.377
Nine in all to die

1413
02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:54.298
and be reborn in the great cycle.

1414
02:33:55.810 --> 02:33:59.019
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1415
02:33:59.939 --> 02:34:04.024
As for our end,
we have two already dedicated...

1416
02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:11.114
and two who have volunteered.

1417
02:34:11.784 --> 02:34:13.901
Ingemar and Ulf.

1418
02:34:17.457 --> 02:34:20.370
You have brought outside offerings.

1419
02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:23.793
Thus volunteering your own bodies.

1420
02:34:25.173 --> 02:34:27.290
You will today be joined

1421
02:34:27.383 --> 02:34:29.215
in harmony with everything.

1422
02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:36.682
And to Pelle, who has brought
new blood and our new May queen,

1423
02:34:37.393 --> 02:34:41.182
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1424
02:34:42.565 --> 02:34:45.854
And so for our ninth offering...

1425
02:34:47.487 --> 02:34:50.605
it is traditional
that our fair queen shall choose

1426
02:34:50.698 --> 02:34:55.989
between a preselected new blood
and a specially ordained Hårgan.

1427
02:35:23.064 --> 02:35:24.064
Torbjorn.

1428
02:35:25.441 --> 02:35:28.684
Honorable Torbjorn, please step forward.

1429
02:35:33.407 --> 02:35:34.407
And...

1430
02:35:53.135 --> 02:35:54.797
Christian Hughes.

1431
02:35:58.182 --> 02:36:02.267
These are the candidates
for the ninth and final offering.

1432
02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:06.472
We patiently await your verdict.
