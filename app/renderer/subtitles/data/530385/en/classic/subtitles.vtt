00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:01.976
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

4
00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:03.477
<i>...the Ardor residence.</i>

5
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.877
<i>Please leave a message</i>

6
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.143
<i>after the tone.</i>

7
00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:11.477
<i>Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, it's Dani.</i>

8
00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.845
<i>Uh, I'm sorry
to be calling so late.</i>

9
00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:16.711
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

10
00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:18.645
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

11
00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:20.011
<i>Um...</i>

12
00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:22.412
<i>Listen, I got kind of
a scary email from Terri</i>

13
00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.078
<i>and she hasn't
been responding.</i>

14
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.212
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

15
00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:30.212
<i>But, uh, yeah,
it sounds like you guys</i>

16
00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:33.279
<i>have been fighting
or something happened.</i>

17
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.145
<i>Anyway, uh, I just got
a little worried.</i>

18
00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:37.945
<i>So, um, if you can call
when you can,</i>

19
00:02:37.947 --> 00:02:40.479
<i>and of course, you know I'm...
I'm always here</i>

20
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:42.079
<i>if you need anything,</i>

21
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.515
<i>of course.</i>

22
00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:49.716
Okay, um, I love you.
All right, bye.

23
00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:02.618
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

24
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.886
What are you up to?

25
00:04:03.888 --> 00:04:07.853
<i>Um, just smoked
some resin with Mark</i>

26
00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:09.186
<i>and now we're getting pizza.</i>

27
00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:10.819
Oh, nice.

28
00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:13.052
- <i>Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.</i>
- <i>Yeah, um...</i>

29
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.985
<i>He's saying "hi"
right now, over and over.</i>

30
00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:19.122
- Hi, Mark.
- <i>Hi, Mark.</i>

31
00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:24.387
So, I was calling
just to see if you...

32
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.656
You still wanted
to hang out later?

33
00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:28.722
<i>Oh.</i>

34
00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:33.221
<i>Did we talk about
doing something tonight?</i>

35
00:04:33.223 --> 00:04:35.220
I mean, not...
Not concretely,

36
00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:37.455
but, um,
I just wanted to see...

37
00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:41.388
<i>Um... Well... Okay.</i>

38
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.087
<i>Yeah, I should be able
to swing by.</i>

39
00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:46.123
- Cool.
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

40
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.524
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

41
00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:56.524
Um, well...

42
00:04:58.057 --> 00:05:00.124
Uh, yeah, um...

43
00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:05.355
I emailed her three times

44
00:05:05.357 --> 00:05:06.723
and still no response

45
00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:09.623
so I'm getting
a little bit nervous, so...

46
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:12.258
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

47
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:14.323
Yeah, probably...

48
00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:15.558
<i>She does this
every other day, Dani.</i>

49
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.824
<i>And only because you let her.</i>

50
00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:19.557
Well, I don't let her,
she's bipolar, so...

51
00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.457
<i>Yeah, I know.
But, you do though, babes.</i>

52
00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:24.726
<i>You go straight
to crisis mode.</i>

53
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.324
Well, she's my sister

54
00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:30.957
and even you said that
this email seemed different.

55
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.026
<i>Yeah, right, but...</i>

56
00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.958
<i>Is it though, really?</i>

57
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.459
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention</i>

58
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:41.093
<i>just like every other
panic attack she's given you.</i>

59
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.695
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.892
You are right, yeah, I know.

61
00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:48.359
<i>I mean, the more you respond</i>

62
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:50.026
<i>the more she's encouraged
to keep...</i>

63
00:05:50.028 --> 00:05:51.726
No, I know, I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

64
00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:53.860
I just... I just needed
to be reminded, thank you.

65
00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:58.128
I'm very lucky to have you.

66
00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:00.596
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

67
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:02.429
I love you.

68
00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:06.395
<i>I love you.</i>

69
00:06:09.496 --> 00:06:11.727
Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

70
00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.060
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

71
00:06:14.062 --> 00:06:16.093
- Bye, Mark.
- <i>Bye, Mark.</i>

72
00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:18.928
Okay, I love you.

73
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.464
- <i>All right.</i>
- Bye.

74
00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:25.695
It's in his tone, like,
you can hear it in his voice,

75
00:06:25.697 --> 00:06:27.662
he's just working up the nerve
to say something.

76
00:06:27.664 --> 00:06:29.328
<i>So be direct!
Confront him.</i>

77
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.763
What if
I've scared him, though?

78
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.228
I'm always roping him
into my family crap.

79
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.496
<i>How do you rope him in?</i>

80
00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:35.062
I'm always leaning on him!

81
00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:36.628
Like, I even called him today
in tears

82
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.095
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary email.

83
00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:41.429
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

84
00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:44.429
What if I'm scaring him off?

85
00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:45.797
<i>What did your sister write?</i>

86
00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:46.995
Mmm.

87
00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:48.363
Just some ominous bullshit

88
00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:50.297
like she always does
and it's torture.

89
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:52.297
And I lean on him constantly
for support.

90
00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:54.764
Like, what if
I have overwhelmed him

91
00:06:54.766 --> 00:06:56.931
and he thinks that I just have
too much baggage?

92
00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.597
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

93
00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.431
No, not if I...
I went too far, if I leaned too much.

94
00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:05.764
<i>You didn't! He should be there
when you need him.</i>

95
00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:07.698
Yeah, but what if
I need him too often

96
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.934
and it becomes a chore?

97
00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.588
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

98
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.121
<i>Because it shouldn't
ever be a chore.</i>

99
00:07:43.123 --> 00:07:44.954
<i>Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you?</i>

100
00:07:44.956 --> 00:07:46.454
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me
for anything.

101
00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:47.722
I've never even seen him cry,

102
00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:49.789
so I'm the only one
that's leaning.

103
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.755
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

104
00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:54.022
<i>The only one
making yourself vulnerable.</i>

105
00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:55.555
<i>That's intimacy.</i>

106
00:07:55.557 --> 00:07:57.489
Dude.

107
00:07:57.491 --> 00:07:59.757
You have gotta
get off the fence with this.

108
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.756
What if
I regret it later

109
00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:05.157
and I can't get her back?

110
00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.391
- You don't want her back!
- But I might.

111
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:09.857
Okay, well, then you can

112
00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:12.423
bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

113
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.123
and then
we'll remind you again

114
00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:15.723
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

115
00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:17.258
for, like, a year now

116
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.657
and then you can find a chick
who actually likes sex

117
00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:21.690
and doesn't drag you through
a million hoops every day.

118
00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:24.124
Do you think there is
a masochistic part of you

119
00:08:24.126 --> 00:08:25.991
that is playing out
this particular drama

120
00:08:25.993 --> 00:08:28.493
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

121
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:32.925
What work do I need
to be doing, Josh, exactly?

122
00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:35.092
Well, I dunno,
your prospectus, maybe?

123
00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:36.491
Your PhD...

124
00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:38.525
Wow, okay,
thanks for the psychoanalysis.

125
00:08:38.527 --> 00:08:39.826
It's not
about academics, Josh.

126
00:08:39.828 --> 00:08:41.391
I'm just trying
to get you focused.

127
00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:43.327
- Change?
- Um, that's for you.

128
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:49.193
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

129
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.793
And don't forget about
all the Swedish women

130
00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.292
you can impregnate in June.

131
00:08:52.294 --> 00:08:53.659
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget about

132
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:54.960
- all the Swedish milkmaids.
- Mmm-hmm.

133
00:08:57.529 --> 00:08:58.795
That's not her again.

134
00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:01.462
Seriously?

135
00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:04.293
Oh, my God.

136
00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:06.127
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

137
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.360
Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

138
00:09:08.362 --> 00:09:09.660
It's literally abuse.

139
00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:11.227
- She's abusing you.
- 'Scuse me.

140
00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:13.293
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

141
00:09:13.295 --> 00:09:14.960
Okay, excuse me, guys.

142
00:09:14.962 --> 00:09:16.429
- Well...
- Great.

143
00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:25.896
- Hey.
- <i>No.</i>

144
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:30.196
- Dani, babe?
- <i>Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.</i>

145
00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:13.341
No, no, no, no, no!

146
00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:55.615
Hey, babe.

147
00:13:56.082 --> 00:13:57.515
How you feeling?

148
00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:06.050
I'm up.

149
00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.347
Where you going?

150
00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:14.314
I was just gonna go
to that party for 45 minutes.

151
00:14:14.316 --> 00:14:15.815
But, you just keep sleeping.

152
00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:16.714
No.

153
00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:18.514
No, I'll come with you.

154
00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:19.815
You sure you got enough sleep?

155
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.818
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

156
00:14:25.584 --> 00:14:27.249
Yeah, I'm fucking
dreading the summer.

157
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:28.649
Stuck in a shit-ass hole

158
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:31.049
listening to my step-mom
fuck my dad all day.

159
00:14:31.051 --> 00:14:33.515
I'll listen to
your step-mom fuck your dad.

160
00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:35.782
Hey, Josh, you, uh,
going to Europe?

161
00:14:35.784 --> 00:14:37.482
Uh, yeah, yeah,
for my thesis,

162
00:14:37.484 --> 00:14:39.817
you know, we all are.

163
00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:42.150
Oh, you're all going?

164
00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:45.316
Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Halsingland.

165
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:46.750
Sweden.

166
00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:49.953
Oh, any occasion,
or is it just for fun?

167
00:14:50.853 --> 00:14:53.617
Uh, well, I'm...
I'm doing my research

168
00:14:53.619 --> 00:14:55.317
on European
midsummer traditions,

169
00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:57.018
these guys
are just tagging along.

170
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.819
Mr. Pelle's invited us to

171
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:01.020
an authentic hippie midsummer
at his yodeling farm.

172
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.619
Oh, yeah?

173
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.119
I mean,
we were talking about it.

174
00:15:09.121 --> 00:15:10.687
We were thinking about it.

175
00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.054
For when?

176
00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:16.119
Uh...

177
00:15:16.121 --> 00:15:17.852
Mid-June to mid-July.

178
00:15:17.854 --> 00:15:20.020
Yeah, two weeks from now?

179
00:15:20.022 --> 00:15:21.552
Yeah.

180
00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:24.053
I mean, that's if we even go.

181
00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:26.519
I'm probably
not gonna go, but...

182
00:15:26.521 --> 00:15:28.055
Yeah, we were talking
about it.

183
00:16:09.225 --> 00:16:10.591
You okay?

184
00:16:11.324 --> 00:16:12.992
Mmm-hmm. Fine.

185
00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:20.025
That was just really weird.

186
00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:22.624
What was?

187
00:16:29.093 --> 00:16:30.492
The...

188
00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:32.892
Sweden.

189
00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.526
I had no idea.

190
00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:39.958
Well, what do you mean?

191
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.960
'Cause I told you
I wanted to go.

192
00:16:44.928 --> 00:16:48.027
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

193
00:16:50.527 --> 00:16:52.394
I just decided today.

194
00:16:53.727 --> 00:16:55.559
I wasn't keeping it from you.

195
00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:57.661
You already have a ticket.

196
00:17:01.295 --> 00:17:02.829
I'm sorry?

197
00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:10.726
Okay, well, just

198
00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:13.493
imagine if you were at a party
and someone said,

199
00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:15.660
"Hey, what're you doing
for summer?"

200
00:17:15.662 --> 00:17:17.761
And then my friend said,

201
00:17:17.763 --> 00:17:20.360
"Oh, we're going to China
for three months

202
00:17:20.362 --> 00:17:21.627
"and we're leaving
in two weeks..."

203
00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:23.028
It's Sweden,
for a month and a half.

204
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.494
And it was the first
you'd ever heard of it.

205
00:17:24.496 --> 00:17:25.828
Okay.

206
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.694
I told you
I wanted to go to Sweden.

207
00:17:27.696 --> 00:17:29.794
No, you said
it would be cool to go.

208
00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:31.360
Yeah, and then
I got the opportunity

209
00:17:31.362 --> 00:17:33.061
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

210
00:17:33.063 --> 00:17:35.461
I just wish you would've
told me, that's all.

211
00:17:35.463 --> 00:17:37.564
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

212
00:17:38.597 --> 00:17:40.628
You didn't apologize,
you said sorry,

213
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.597
which sounds more like,
"Too bad."

214
00:17:47.463 --> 00:17:48.896
Maybe I should just go home.

215
00:17:48.898 --> 00:17:50.598
What? No, no.

216
00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.729
I'm just trying to understand.

217
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:54.863
And I'm trying to apologize.

218
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.663
And I don't need an apology.

219
00:17:56.665 --> 00:17:58.832
I don't, I just wanted to talk
about it, that's all.

220
00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:03.263
I really think
I should just leave.

221
00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:05.063
No, no, no, no.

222
00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:06.664
Please, please, please. I'm not...
I'm not trying to attack you.

223
00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:07.997
- It really feels like you are.
- I'm not.

224
00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:09.598
Well, then...
Well, then I'm sorry.

225
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.964
I'm... I just got confused.
I'm sorry, I...

226
00:18:12.966 --> 00:18:15.331
Hey, please, c'mon,
can you come?

227
00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:16.397
- Just can you come and sit...
- Stop.

228
00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:17.665
...with me, please?

229
00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:19.998
Please, and we can
talk about it.

230
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.898
Look, it just... It just felt
really weird, okay?

231
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.732
But I'm fine,
I think it's great

232
00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:26.568
that you're going to Sweden,
I do.

233
00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:28.567
I think it's amazing.

234
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.567
Are you going for your thesis?

235
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:35.799
I don't know
what my thesis is.

236
00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:38.534
I know and it...
It can... It will...

237
00:18:40.302 --> 00:18:42.569
It can be inspiring, right?

238
00:18:44.402 --> 00:18:45.734
Right?

239
00:18:49.769 --> 00:18:52.001
In Stockholm, are there
any, like, meatball sex clubs

240
00:18:52.003 --> 00:18:54.433
we should hit up
before we head north?

241
00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:56.102
No, we're going
straight north.

242
00:18:57.802 --> 00:18:59.401
Not straight, straight,
though, right?

243
00:18:59.403 --> 00:19:00.434
We gotta go through Stockholm

244
00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:01.633
to get there.

245
00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:02.734
No, it's
the opposite direction.

246
00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:04.868
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

247
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.334
Guys, it's Dani.

248
00:19:06.336 --> 00:19:07.736
She's coming up.

249
00:19:09.336 --> 00:19:10.802
Okay.

250
00:19:10.804 --> 00:19:13.670
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

251
00:19:21.737 --> 00:19:24.604
Um,
I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

252
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:27.269
So you guys know.

253
00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:28.735
She's not actually gonna come,

254
00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:31.405
but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

255
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:35.438
- You invited her to...
- Mmm-hmm.

256
00:19:36.139 --> 00:19:37.772
But she's not coming.

257
00:19:39.272 --> 00:19:40.639
She doesn't want to?

258
00:19:42.573 --> 00:19:45.603
I invited her
and she accepted,

259
00:19:45.605 --> 00:19:48.505
but she's not actually coming
to Sweden.

260
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.406
Okay.

261
00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:54.941
Guys, you know
what she's been going through.

262
00:19:56.106 --> 00:19:59.572
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh,
thought it was...

263
00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.105
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

264
00:20:01.107 --> 00:20:03.005
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

265
00:20:03.007 --> 00:20:04.640
Okay, that's great.

266
00:20:05.874 --> 00:20:09.471
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her

267
00:20:09.473 --> 00:20:10.773
and you all know
that she's coming...

268
00:20:10.775 --> 00:20:12.139
Agreed?

269
00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:13.439
Yep.

270
00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:15.041
- Hey!
- Hey, babe!

271
00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:17.572
Hey, guys.

272
00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:19.472
- Hey.
- Yo.

273
00:20:19.474 --> 00:20:20.908
How's it going?

274
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:23.907
We're chilling.

275
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:25.043
Nice.

276
00:20:27.509 --> 00:20:29.640
So, Sweden.

277
00:20:29.642 --> 00:20:31.241
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

278
00:20:31.243 --> 00:20:33.308
I mean, I...

279
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.707
I guess so,

280
00:20:34.709 --> 00:20:36.740
if that's not completely
ruining you guys' plans.

281
00:20:36.742 --> 00:20:38.876
- Oh, no, no.
- No, not at all.

282
00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:45.675
Uh, Christian,
can I get you to take a look

283
00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.476
at this paragraph real quick?

284
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:50.777
Uh, yeah, sure.

285
00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.643
- I'll be back.
- Mmm-hmm.

286
00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:00.611
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

287
00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:11.077
What were you drawing?

288
00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:12.442
Uh, just the table.

289
00:21:12.444 --> 00:21:13.679
Oh.

290
00:21:15.111 --> 00:21:16.079
How have you been?

291
00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:18.144
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

292
00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:21.144
Survived finals, you know.

293
00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:23.777
- And you?
- Uh...

294
00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:25.212
I didn't quite finish,

295
00:21:25.214 --> 00:21:28.945
but they're giving me
a break this year.

296
00:21:28.947 --> 00:21:31.344
Oh, God, yes, yes,
of course. Sorry.

297
00:21:31.346 --> 00:21:32.744
It's, uh...

298
00:21:32.746 --> 00:21:34.647
How did you like
the Anthropology department?

299
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.611
I like it, yeah.

300
00:21:36.613 --> 00:21:38.613
Not as much as
this one maybe, but...

301
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.112
You're doing psychiatry,
right?

302
00:21:43.114 --> 00:21:44.512
Uh, psychology, yeah.

303
00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:47.012
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

304
00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:49.313
Yeah, also that funny look
in your eye.

305
00:21:50.948 --> 00:21:53.046
So you're coming
to Halsingland?

306
00:21:53.048 --> 00:21:54.379
I guess so, yeah.

307
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:57.913
And, um, we'll actually
be arriving on my birthday.

308
00:21:57.915 --> 00:22:00.513
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you!

309
00:22:00.515 --> 00:22:05.413
Yeah, Christian says you've
got this special week planned.

310
00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:07.080
Yeah, it's sort of a crazy

311
00:22:07.082 --> 00:22:08.947
nine-day festival
my family's doing.

312
00:22:08.949 --> 00:22:11.014
- Lots of pageantry...
- Uh-huh.

313
00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:12.914
...special ceremonies,
and dressing up.

314
00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:14.514
That sounds fun.

315
00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:16.447
It'll probably seem
very silly.

316
00:22:16.449 --> 00:22:18.815
But, it's like theater.

317
00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:20.148
Yeah, Christian says you're...

318
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.014
You're from
like a commune, right?

319
00:22:23.016 --> 00:22:25.117
Yeah, we're...
We're a small community.

320
00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:28.051
Here. I'll show you.

321
00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:35.182
Oh, wow.

322
00:22:35.184 --> 00:22:37.715
I see what you mean
about the pageantry.

323
00:22:37.717 --> 00:22:39.083
Yeah, we make
those clothes special

324
00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:41.283
for every
winter and summer solstice.

325
00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:44.382
I mean, everybody sort of
does everything together.

326
00:22:44.384 --> 00:22:45.983
That's an interesting symbol.

327
00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:49.382
Yeah, we're taught
the Runic alphabet, so...

328
00:22:49.384 --> 00:22:51.684
Whoa, who's that one?

329
00:22:51.686 --> 00:22:54.119
- That's last year's May Queen.
- Uh-huh.

330
00:22:55.019 --> 00:22:56.352
Beautiful.

331
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:00.352
You know, I'm very, very glad
you're coming.

332
00:23:01.886 --> 00:23:04.787
I... I think
it's very good you're coming.

333
00:23:05.352 --> 00:23:06.886
Thank you.

334
00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.618
Also, I...

335
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.384
I never had the chance
to tell you...

336
00:23:11.386 --> 00:23:14.052
- Mmm.
- ...but I was...

337
00:23:14.054 --> 00:23:17.587
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

338
00:23:18.386 --> 00:23:21.185
- Oh.
- What happened, I mean,

339
00:23:21.187 --> 00:23:22.887
I can't even imagine.

340
00:23:23.387 --> 00:23:24.718
I mean...

341
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.485
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

342
00:23:26.487 --> 00:23:28.153
I kind of have some idea.

343
00:23:28.155 --> 00:23:29.752
- I'm sorry.
- No!

344
00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:31.253
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

345
00:23:31.255 --> 00:23:33.688
I'm gonna just go
to the bathroom, thank you.

346
00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:25.922
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

347
00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:29.123
<i>we are beginning our initial
descent into Stockholm...</i>

348
00:24:37.793 --> 00:24:40.957
Oh, my God, the women here.

349
00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:42.991
What is it
that makes them hotter?

350
00:24:42.993 --> 00:24:44.757
The Vikings
grabbed all the best babes

351
00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:48.159
from other countries
and dragged them over.

352
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:50.624
Christian, you can do
your thesis on that.

353
00:24:50.626 --> 00:24:52.225
How long is the drive?

354
00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:53.391
About four hours.

355
00:24:53.393 --> 00:24:55.393
Oh, my God.

356
00:26:02.098 --> 00:26:04.629
Okay,
this is the first stop.

357
00:26:04.631 --> 00:26:05.864
This is it?

358
00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:07.832
Not quite, almost.

359
00:26:12.999 --> 00:26:14.099
Pelle!

360
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.097
- Hey!
- Hey!

361
00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:17.663
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

362
00:26:17.665 --> 00:26:18.597
Hey, guys,
so these are younger people

363
00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:20.065
from my village.

364
00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:22.033
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

365
00:26:22.465 --> 00:26:23.766
Come on over.

366
00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:26.865
Hey!

367
00:26:26.867 --> 00:26:29.033
These are my friends
from America.

368
00:26:31.366 --> 00:26:33.632
- Oh, dude.
- Hey.

369
00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:35.066
Just fucking walk.

370
00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:36.531
Yeah, dude,
there's so many bugs.

371
00:26:36.533 --> 00:26:38.101
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mmm.

372
00:26:44.567 --> 00:26:45.733
Okay, so this is, uh...

373
00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:47.233
- Mark, Dani...
- Hi.

374
00:26:47.235 --> 00:26:49.967
Christian and Josh.

375
00:26:49.969 --> 00:26:51.766
What?

376
00:26:51.768 --> 00:26:54.600
Give me just one second.

377
00:26:54.602 --> 00:26:56.100
You think
he knows that guy?

378
00:26:56.102 --> 00:26:57.167
He sounded mad.

379
00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:09.168
That must be good.

380
00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.134
Here! Come on over,
come on over.

381
00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:20.069
This is, uh, these are
my great friends from America.

382
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.169
Christian, Dani,

383
00:27:21.171 --> 00:27:22.635
- Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

384
00:27:22.637 --> 00:27:24.269
Meet my brother, Ingemar.

385
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:26.302
Uh, best friends since
we were babies, actually.

386
00:27:26.304 --> 00:27:27.602
Yeah.

387
00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:30.803
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

388
00:27:30.805 --> 00:27:32.135
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

389
00:27:32.137 --> 00:27:34.237
Awesome! And say hello
to my friends.

390
00:27:34.239 --> 00:27:35.768
This is Simon and Connie

391
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.402
- from London.
- How's it going?

392
00:27:37.404 --> 00:27:39.536
- Hi.
- Simon, this is Pelle...

393
00:27:39.538 --> 00:27:41.703
And these are all the names

394
00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:43.237
I just learned
two seconds ago.

395
00:27:45.305 --> 00:27:46.670
Perfect timing, by the way,

396
00:27:46.672 --> 00:27:49.470
we... We just took these
five minutes ago.

397
00:27:49.472 --> 00:27:51.505
Haven't even started
coming up yet.

398
00:27:52.073 --> 00:27:53.904
Oh, shit!

399
00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:56.837
Do you guys wanna take it now
or should we settle in first?

400
00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:58.304
Fuck it,
let's just take it now, right?

401
00:27:58.306 --> 00:27:59.639
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

402
00:28:00.139 --> 00:28:01.671
Uh, you know what,

403
00:28:01.673 --> 00:28:04.638
I might have to find
my footing first if that's okay.

404
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.239
- Uh, yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

405
00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:08.905
And listen,
if you're feeling uneasy,

406
00:28:08.907 --> 00:28:10.738
you don't have
to take them at all.

407
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.305
No. No, no, no. I just...
I wanna feel settled first.

408
00:28:13.307 --> 00:28:14.740
- Okay.
- Okay.

409
00:28:15.941 --> 00:28:17.839
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

410
00:28:17.841 --> 00:28:19.273
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

411
00:28:19.275 --> 00:28:21.039
I want us to come up together.

412
00:28:21.041 --> 00:28:23.306
- Ready?
- Okay?

413
00:28:23.308 --> 00:28:26.041
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

414
00:28:28.042 --> 00:28:30.340
Dude, we can't take them
at different times,

415
00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:31.909
they'll be
totally separate trips.

416
00:28:33.575 --> 00:28:35.542
You wanna wait for us then?

417
00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:43.075
You know what,
it's fine, it's fine.

418
00:28:43.077 --> 00:28:44.773
- Babe... Babe, no.
- I'm ready.

419
00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:46.175
- No, it's okay,
- Don't feel rushed.

420
00:28:46.177 --> 00:28:48.010
I don't, I don't.
It's fine, I'm ready.

421
00:28:49.476 --> 00:28:50.909
Are you sure?

422
00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:54.841
Yes, Mark, thank you.

423
00:28:54.843 --> 00:28:56.641
- They've made mushroom tea.
- Mmm-hmm.

424
00:28:56.643 --> 00:28:58.176
If you prefer
against the taste.

425
00:28:58.178 --> 00:29:00.641
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll try that, thank you.

426
00:29:00.643 --> 00:29:02.109
- Ingemar? Ingemar?
- Ingemar.

427
00:29:02.111 --> 00:29:04.011
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.
- Perfect.

428
00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:06.842
Don't let Mark be the one

429
00:29:06.844 --> 00:29:08.109
- to pressure you.
- He's not.

430
00:29:08.111 --> 00:29:10.042
- Of all people.
- He's not, he's not.

431
00:29:10.044 --> 00:29:11.476
It will... It will get
complicated otherwise, it's fine.

432
00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:13.177
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

433
00:29:13.179 --> 00:29:14.709
- There you go.
- Ooh.

434
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:15.877
Thanks, dude.

435
00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:17.676
Okay,
here we go then.

436
00:29:17.678 --> 00:29:19.110
- Think happy thoughts!
- Are you sure about this?

437
00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:21.476
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers!

438
00:29:23.112 --> 00:29:25.177
- All right.
- Yeah?

439
00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:26.611
Are you sure about this?

440
00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:28.710
I think it's gonna be fun.

441
00:29:28.712 --> 00:29:30.746
- We're in?
- Yep, go.

442
00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:37.544
What time is it?

443
00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:40.680
It's 9:00 p.m.

444
00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.014
What do you mean?

445
00:29:45.613 --> 00:29:47.047
What do you mean?

446
00:29:48.379 --> 00:29:50.547
That can't be right!
The sky is blue!

447
00:29:51.513 --> 00:29:53.746
It's fine, it's Sweden.

448
00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:56.812
That's not fine!
Why is it like that?

449
00:29:56.814 --> 00:29:59.745
It's okay, Mark.
It's the midnight sun.

450
00:29:59.747 --> 00:30:02.080
That feels wrong,
I don't like that!

451
00:30:02.082 --> 00:30:04.313
I promise you,
it's okay.

452
00:30:04.315 --> 00:30:05.679
I'm not okay.

453
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:07.479
Oh, fuck,
it's a new person.

454
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:08.713
What?

455
00:30:08.715 --> 00:30:11.113
I don't want new people
right now.

456
00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:13.915
No,
new people are good, Mark.

457
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:16.382
Hi, hi!

458
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:20.814
I'm just gonna lay down, okay?

459
00:30:20.816 --> 00:30:22.348
Yeah, do that.

460
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.415
Everybody else lay down.

461
00:30:27.483 --> 00:30:29.747
Guys, do it, it feels so nice.

462
00:30:32.683 --> 00:30:34.683
Josh, can you lie down,
please?

463
00:30:36.416 --> 00:30:38.051
Can you feel that?

464
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.148
The energy.

465
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.716
Coming up from the earth.

466
00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:57.483
Look!

467
00:30:57.485 --> 00:30:59.885
The trees too,
they're breathing.

468
00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:09.284
Nature just knows
instinctively

469
00:31:09.286 --> 00:31:11.119
how to stay in harmony.

470
00:31:13.553 --> 00:31:16.820
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

471
00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:26.587
You guys are like my family.

472
00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:32.286
You're like my real,
actual family.

473
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:35.719
Dani?

474
00:31:38.387 --> 00:31:39.753
Sorry.

475
00:31:39.755 --> 00:31:42.953
Uh, I'm gonna go for a walk.

476
00:31:42.955 --> 00:31:44.720
I can walk, too.

477
00:31:44.722 --> 00:31:47.486
No, I'm good.

478
00:31:49.855 --> 00:31:51.722
No, no, no, no.

479
00:31:52.555 --> 00:31:54.320
Don't think that. You're fine.

480
00:31:54.322 --> 00:31:55.854
It's almost your birthday.

481
00:31:55.856 --> 00:31:59.487
You're okay, you're fine.
You're fine.

482
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:11.555
Stop it! I'm fine.

483
00:32:11.557 --> 00:32:13.156
Hey, Dani!

484
00:32:15.957 --> 00:32:17.157
How are you?

485
00:32:18.457 --> 00:32:20.256
They were laughing at me.

486
00:32:20.258 --> 00:32:23.457
What? No, no, no,
I'm sure they weren't.

487
00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:25.791
They've been laughing.

488
00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:28.558
Want to come meet my friends?

489
00:32:31.458 --> 00:32:35.058
Thank you.
I'm sorry, thank you.

490
00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:44.726
Stop it! Stop it, fuck!

491
00:32:48.126 --> 00:32:51.593
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

492
00:33:27.494 --> 00:33:28.896
Hey.

493
00:33:36.229 --> 00:33:37.962
How long was I asleep?

494
00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:41.295
I mean,

495
00:33:41.297 --> 00:33:43.763
we found you here, like,
six hours ago.

496
00:33:49.831 --> 00:33:51.697
Did it get dark at all?

497
00:33:54.064 --> 00:33:56.931
For a couple of hours,
not completely.

498
00:33:58.664 --> 00:34:01.029
Is it tomorrow?

499
00:34:01.031 --> 00:34:04.031
I mean,
from yesterday's perspective.

500
00:34:08.299 --> 00:34:09.731
Come on.

501
00:34:12.865 --> 00:34:14.663
Where are we going?

502
00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:15.899
What we came for.

503
00:34:55.035 --> 00:34:57.166
Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

504
00:34:57.168 --> 00:34:59.635
Yeah, this is way
the hell out there.

505
00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:06.166
Do they have ticks
in Sweden?

506
00:35:06.168 --> 00:35:08.068
Sweden has a tick problem.

507
00:35:08.469 --> 00:35:09.600
What?

508
00:35:09.602 --> 00:35:10.867
No they don't, do they really?

509
00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:12.533
Actually,
it is a big problem.

510
00:35:12.535 --> 00:35:14.368
Last summer,
a record number of people

511
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.134
got tick-borne encephalitis.

512
00:35:16.136 --> 00:35:18.533
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

513
00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:20.701
Both my grandparents
died from ticks.

514
00:35:20.703 --> 00:35:22.401
Had to give them
a closed casket funeral.

515
00:35:22.403 --> 00:35:26.401
Okay, Josh, I actually
have an uncle with Lyme.

516
00:35:26.403 --> 00:35:27.968
And believe me,
if you ask him,

517
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.303
it was not worth the pleasant
picnic in the park.

518
00:35:30.305 --> 00:35:31.470
He's fucked.

519
00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:16.604
So, this is the place.

520
00:36:16.606 --> 00:36:19.539
The tranquil
and majestic Harga.

521
00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:24.373
Pelle, you know
all these people?

522
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:26.008
These are my family!

523
00:36:30.807 --> 00:36:32.072
So we're stopping in Waco

524
00:36:32.074 --> 00:36:33.774
before going
to Pelle's village?

525
00:36:46.975 --> 00:36:49.041
Oh, thank you!

526
00:36:49.043 --> 00:36:51.275
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

527
00:36:51.277 --> 00:36:53.340
- Oh, wow, thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

528
00:36:53.342 --> 00:36:54.643
This bag?

529
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.944
Thank you... Uh, sorry.

530
00:36:58.409 --> 00:37:00.174
Hey, guys?

531
00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:01.608
Meet my sister, Dagny.

532
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.475
Born the exact same day as me.

533
00:37:03.477 --> 00:37:06.542
- Hi.
- Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

534
00:37:09.077 --> 00:37:10.942
- Uh, <i>tack!</i>
- Thank you.

535
00:37:10.944 --> 00:37:12.710
- <i>Tack.</i>
- Hey.

536
00:37:24.379 --> 00:37:25.845
Father Odd!

537
00:37:43.947 --> 00:37:45.911
Sorry,
these are my friends.

538
00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:48.580
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

539
00:37:49.446 --> 00:37:50.610
- Hello.
- Hi.

540
00:37:52.512 --> 00:37:53.945
Welcome, welcome.

541
00:37:53.947 --> 00:37:55.780
- Hi, oh!
- Welcome home.

542
00:37:56.647 --> 00:37:59.679
We are so very happy
to have you.

543
00:37:59.681 --> 00:38:01.112
Oh, thank you.

544
00:38:01.114 --> 00:38:04.514
Pelle has an immaculate sense
for people.

545
00:38:05.713 --> 00:38:07.445
I... I love
what you're wearing.

546
00:38:07.447 --> 00:38:08.512
- My frock?
- Uh-huh.

547
00:38:08.514 --> 00:38:09.881
Yeah, quite girly, no?

548
00:38:10.915 --> 00:38:13.747
We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

549
00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:16.113
and because of the nature's

550
00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:21.147
hermaphrodite,
I think, qualities. Yeah.

551
00:38:21.149 --> 00:38:24.348
Wow, I think the Sakhis saints
do the same thing

552
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.282
in Brajbhoomi?

553
00:38:26.284 --> 00:38:28.915
So, we are your hosts.

554
00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:30.648
So whatever you need,
just say so

555
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.481
and we will accommodate, okay?

556
00:38:32.483 --> 00:38:33.947
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

557
00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:35.648
Today is all festivities.

558
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.547
Um, just tomorrow,
the official ceremony begin

559
00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:40.148
and you are welcome!

560
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.547
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

561
00:38:42.549 --> 00:38:44.481
Yeah. Enjoy.

562
00:38:44.483 --> 00:38:46.617
Just... Thank you.

563
00:38:48.218 --> 00:38:50.084
That guy
has a very red face.

564
00:38:50.617 --> 00:38:52.184
Yeah?

565
00:38:54.684 --> 00:38:57.052
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:40:02.255 --> 00:40:05.620
- Can I take photos?
- Um... Discreetly.

567
00:40:09.089 --> 00:40:10.156
Thanks.

568
00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:12.720
Oh, forgive me.

569
00:40:12.722 --> 00:40:15.589
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

570
00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:18.823
Welcome to Harga,

571
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.055
and happy midsummer!

572
00:40:21.057 --> 00:40:24.955
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast

573
00:40:24.957 --> 00:40:28.290
and it will be 90 years
before our next.

574
00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:31.023
And what poetry
that it's now the hottest

575
00:40:31.025 --> 00:40:33.789
and brightest summer
on record.

576
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.890
We already have
so much to give back

577
00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:39.590
and so, without any
further blathering,

578
00:40:39.592 --> 00:40:41.791
let's raise our glasses.

579
00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:47.759
Let our
Nine-Day feast commence.

580
00:42:26.265 --> 00:42:28.530
You guys should join.

581
00:42:28.532 --> 00:42:31.766
Oh, no, I'm too scared.

582
00:42:37.934 --> 00:42:40.499
- All right.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

583
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:44.899
What are the kids playing?

584
00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:46.932
Skin the fool.

585
00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:49.501
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

586
00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.466
Precious.

587
00:43:04.935 --> 00:43:07.200
Hey, Pelle,
can anybody just join in?

588
00:43:07.202 --> 00:43:10.602
You're an American,
just jam yourself in there.

589
00:43:10.969 --> 00:43:12.102
All right.

590
00:43:15.036 --> 00:43:16.136
Hey.

591
00:43:17.202 --> 00:43:18.969
Happy birthday.

592
00:43:21.735 --> 00:43:23.968
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

593
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.668
Just something I do
for birthdays.

594
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.167
Maybe it's not appropriate?

595
00:43:28.169 --> 00:43:31.835
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

596
00:43:31.837 --> 00:43:34.135
It's beautiful.

597
00:43:34.137 --> 00:43:36.070
Anyway, just between us.

598
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:39.236
Yeah, well...

599
00:43:39.238 --> 00:43:42.504
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

600
00:43:43.138 --> 00:43:44.635
Oh.

601
00:43:44.637 --> 00:43:46.969
No. No, no, no,
I forgot to remind him

602
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:49.171
and it's not
his fault, it's...

603
00:43:50.438 --> 00:43:51.536
Never mind, it's okay.

604
00:43:51.538 --> 00:43:53.170
This is beautiful.

605
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.705
Thank you so much,
I'm really touched.

606
00:43:57.672 --> 00:44:00.037
So, how do you support
this place?

607
00:44:00.039 --> 00:44:02.603
Lumbering, linen,
homeopathics...

608
00:44:02.605 --> 00:44:03.972
Water power plant.

609
00:44:05.872 --> 00:44:07.572
School time over here.

610
00:44:08.538 --> 00:44:09.804
Carving runes?

611
00:44:09.806 --> 00:44:11.006
Really?

612
00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:15.637
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

613
00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:18.238
Oh, yeah.
I do that, too.

614
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.238
Oh, fuck.
There's a big one.

615
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.004
Oh, shit.

616
00:44:22.006 --> 00:44:23.806
What alphabet is that from?

617
00:44:24.341 --> 00:44:27.139
Uh, the Younger Futhark.

618
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:29.005
I... I think?
Or is that medieval?

619
00:44:29.007 --> 00:44:31.738
Actually, that is
the Elder Futhark.

620
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.606
So, how long have you two
been together?

621
00:44:34.608 --> 00:44:36.838
- Oh, geez, um...
- Um...

622
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.740
Just over
three and a half years.

623
00:44:39.441 --> 00:44:40.806
Four years.

624
00:44:40.808 --> 00:44:43.407
- No? Really?
- Yeah.

625
00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:44.942
Four years in two weeks.

626
00:44:46.608 --> 00:44:47.941
You're right, I'm sorry.

627
00:44:47.943 --> 00:44:50.108
- You're right. Four years.
- Mmm-hmm.

628
00:44:52.142 --> 00:44:55.608
Yeah, um,
how did you guys all meet?

629
00:44:57.243 --> 00:44:58.573
Well, uh...

630
00:44:58.575 --> 00:45:00.674
We were all working
on the same farm

631
00:45:00.676 --> 00:45:03.607
and funny enough,
I was dating Connie

632
00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:05.974
when Simon and me
first became pals.

633
00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:08.275
Well, we'd been on a date.

634
00:45:08.277 --> 00:45:10.607
And I didn't even actually
know it was a date, so...

635
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:12.108
You're right. No, no.

636
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.641
I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends.

637
00:45:13.643 --> 00:45:15.608
We... We decided to be friends.

638
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.076
And that was just before

639
00:45:17.078 --> 00:45:19.409
Connie and Simon
started dating.

640
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:21.075
And now they're engaged.

641
00:45:21.077 --> 00:45:23.676
- What? Congratulations!
- Wow.

642
00:45:23.678 --> 00:45:25.675
Which is amazing,
yes, congratulations.

643
00:45:25.677 --> 00:45:28.642
Yeah, thanks. Yeah,
we actually asked Ingemar

644
00:45:28.644 --> 00:45:30.177
to officiate the wedding.

645
00:45:30.179 --> 00:45:31.842
- Really?
- Nah.

646
00:45:31.844 --> 00:45:33.946
- Oh.
- What's that building over there?

647
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:36.810
It's like a sacred temple,

648
00:45:36.812 --> 00:45:38.844
but no one's allowed in there.

649
00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:42.610
Uh, let me show you
where we sleep.

650
00:45:42.612 --> 00:45:46.111
Let me show you
the <i>Rotvalta!</i>

651
00:45:46.113 --> 00:45:48.279
So we're just gonna ignore
the bear then?

652
00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:50.513
It's a bear.

653
00:45:55.546 --> 00:45:56.813
What's that?

654
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.913
- We can check it out.
- Yeah.

655
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:10.614
Love story.

656
00:46:48.251 --> 00:46:51.951
Oh, wow. What? Wow.

657
00:46:55.684 --> 00:46:56.884
Wow.

658
00:46:58.518 --> 00:47:00.518
Wow, wow, wow.

659
00:47:02.218 --> 00:47:05.448
Oh, man. Wow.

660
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.718
It's like in the Scripture.

661
00:47:12.686 --> 00:47:14.018
What do you think?

662
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:17.186
It's like another world.

663
00:47:18.219 --> 00:47:19.917
Amazing.

664
00:47:19.919 --> 00:47:21.517
People just sleep here?

665
00:47:21.519 --> 00:47:22.617
Yeah, all the younger ones

666
00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:23.917
until we turn 36

667
00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:25.583
and then we move
to the laborers house.

668
00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:26.984
Why 36?

669
00:47:26.986 --> 00:47:29.284
Well, we think of life
like the seasons.

670
00:47:29.286 --> 00:47:32.152
So you're a child until
you're 18 and that's Spring.

671
00:47:32.154 --> 00:47:34.385
And then at some point,
we all do our Pilgrimage

672
00:47:34.387 --> 00:47:36.185
which is between 18 and 36.

673
00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:40.651
That's Summer,
and then from 36 to 54,

674
00:47:40.653 --> 00:47:43.152
we're working age,
which is Fall.

675
00:47:43.154 --> 00:47:46.787
And then finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor.

676
00:47:48.787 --> 00:47:50.221
What happens at 72?

677
00:47:54.388 --> 00:47:55.987
Not a lot of privacy.

678
00:47:55.989 --> 00:47:57.986
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

679
00:47:57.988 --> 00:47:59.620
Especially with all these
dicks on the wall.

680
00:47:59.622 --> 00:48:00.687
There's a lot of dicks.

681
00:48:17.223 --> 00:48:18.554
Did she say something?

682
00:48:18.556 --> 00:48:20.021
No, no, no, absolutely not.

683
00:48:20.023 --> 00:48:22.621
I just wanted to
let you know before, so...

684
00:48:22.623 --> 00:48:24.157
Are these the May Queens?

685
00:48:24.923 --> 00:48:26.422
Yeah.

686
00:48:26.424 --> 00:48:29.290
Right. Uh, you'll actually
be here for that.

687
00:48:30.023 --> 00:48:32.423
And who are your May Queens?

688
00:48:32.425 --> 00:48:35.256
Uh, every mid-summer,
we have this dance competition

689
00:48:35.258 --> 00:48:37.056
and the winner gets crowned
and this is...

690
00:48:37.058 --> 00:48:39.855
- Oh, wow.
- Hey!

691
00:49:19.815 --> 00:49:20.915
Was that...

692
00:49:22.015 --> 00:49:23.481
You saw that too, right?

693
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:26.947
Pelle, who was that?

694
00:49:26.949 --> 00:49:28.614
Inge.

695
00:49:28.616 --> 00:49:30.846
Oh, my God,
I want to give her a bath.

696
00:49:30.848 --> 00:49:33.682
Hey, can I pull you outside
for a sec?

697
00:49:34.382 --> 00:49:35.916
Yeah, sure.

698
00:49:38.582 --> 00:49:40.616
Pelle,
tell her to come back.

699
00:49:49.784 --> 00:49:52.682

00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:08.352
Fuck.

705
00:50:10.019 --> 00:50:11.852
- Stop, it's fine.
- What?

706
00:50:12.919 --> 00:50:15.252
You didn't think
I forgot, did you?

707
00:50:17.752 --> 00:50:19.017
I'm sorry.

708
00:50:19.019 --> 00:50:20.750
I'm sorry I got fucked up
by the daylight

709
00:50:20.752 --> 00:50:22.250
and I thought
it was yesterday.

710
00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:23.617
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Happy birthday.

711
00:50:23.619 --> 00:50:24.817
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. I'm not upset.

712
00:50:24.819 --> 00:50:25.885
It's okay.

713
00:50:25.887 --> 00:50:27.820
- You should be.
- I... I should be.

714
00:50:28.385 --> 00:50:29.753
I'm sorry.

715
00:50:54.954 --> 00:50:56.855
All right, beauty rest.

716
00:50:57.955 --> 00:50:59.488
Tomorrow's a big day.

717
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:02.753
What's tomorrow?

718
00:51:02.755 --> 00:51:04.488
First of the big ceremonies.

719
00:51:09.289 --> 00:51:10.956
<i>Attestupa.</i>

720
00:51:12.723 --> 00:51:14.021
What's that?

721
00:51:14.023 --> 00:51:15.621
Uh, it's too hard to explain,

722
00:51:15.623 --> 00:51:17.788
you'll get
a better sense tomorrow.

723
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:21.289
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

724
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.321
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one?

725
00:51:26.323 --> 00:51:28.655
I mean,
it's pretty actual.

726
00:51:28.657 --> 00:51:29.724
Fuck.

727
00:51:31.624 --> 00:51:33.290
Do you know what it is?

728
00:51:36.899 --> 00:51:37.932
Dude!

729
00:51:39.932 --> 00:51:41.599
Is it scary?

730
00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.965
That is so fucking annoying.

731
00:51:46.967 --> 00:51:49.032
Yo! Check my scalp for ticks,

732
00:51:49.034 --> 00:51:50.232
then I'll check yours.

733
00:53:16.906 --> 00:53:18.172
Somebody should tell
those girls

734
00:53:18.174 --> 00:53:19.572
they're walking stupid.

735
00:53:26.939 --> 00:53:29.738
How long
do they typically stand?

736
00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.640
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

737
00:53:36.008 --> 00:53:38.506
Hey. Oh.

738
00:53:38.508 --> 00:53:40.508
- Are these for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

739
00:53:41.307 --> 00:53:43.307
- You pick 'em backwards?
- Yeah.

740
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:49.110
Are those the ones?

741
00:54:49.112 --> 00:54:50.446
Yeah.

742
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.845
Dude, I'm so hungry.

743
00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.981
It's like they're trying
to make it gross.

744
00:55:34.115 --> 00:55:36.679
Her... Her mother
is on Pilgrimage.

745
00:55:36.681 --> 00:55:38.749
- Oh...
- Helps her to detach.

746
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:40.714
Okay.

747
00:55:40.716 --> 00:55:42.482
The babies
are raised here by everyone.

748
00:55:43.151 --> 00:55:45.282
Wow. You want this?

749
00:58:14.493 --> 00:58:16.358
Dude, are you
following them out?

750
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.992
I'm beat.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

751
00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:20.658
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

752
00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.493
Wait,
what're we doing now?

753
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.034
What is that book?

754
01:00:24.036 --> 01:00:26.601
<i>Rubi Radr.</i>
Our scripture.

755
01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:31.400
Can I read that?

756
01:00:31.402 --> 01:00:32.836
You would not be able.

757
01:02:58.113 --> 01:03:00.013
Oh, my God!

758
01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:04.610
It's fine.

759
01:03:04.612 --> 01:03:06.244
Did she jump?

760
01:03:06.246 --> 01:03:07.478
What the...

761
01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.778
It's part of the ceremony.

762
01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.977
What?
No, she fell, she fell.

763
01:03:09.979 --> 01:03:11.311
Fuck!

764
01:03:11.313 --> 01:03:13.478
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

765
01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.845
It's okay.

766
01:03:14.847 --> 01:03:16.778
Oh, my...
Did she fall or did she jump?

767
01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.279
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry.

768
01:03:19.281 --> 01:03:20.645
What do you mean it's fine?

769
01:03:20.647 --> 01:03:22.546
She's fucking dead.
Look at her head!

770
01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:24.312
Look at her head, she's dead!

771
01:03:24.314 --> 01:03:25.945
It's a part
of the ceremony.

772
01:03:25.947 --> 01:03:27.379
Why the fuck are you
standing there like that?

773
01:03:27.381 --> 01:03:29.712
She just fucking jumped
off the cliff.

774
01:03:29.714 --> 01:03:33.314
Are you freaking blind?
What the... Fuck!

775
01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:38.415
Oh, my God.

776
01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.848
What the fuck?

777
01:03:51.783 --> 01:03:54.550
No, he's doing...
He's doing the same thing.

778
01:03:55.383 --> 01:03:56.782
He's doing the same
fucking thing!

779
01:03:58.683 --> 01:04:01.315
Someone stop!
Sir, don't do it.

780
01:04:01.317 --> 01:04:02.881
Tell him to stop.

781
01:04:02.883 --> 01:04:05.381
Why's everyone just
standing there, what the fuck?

782
01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:08.549
Sir, don't...
Don't jump, don't jump!

783
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:10.216
Please, someone tell him
not to jump.

784
01:04:10.218 --> 01:04:11.649
- What the fuck?
- Someone tell him...

785
01:04:35.153 --> 01:04:37.516
- He's still alive.
- What's going on?

786
01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.589
Fuck, we're going.

787
01:05:45.591 --> 01:05:48.522
- Fuck! This is fucked!
- Where?

788
01:05:48.524 --> 01:05:50.956
Fuck this! You're fucked!

789
01:05:50.958 --> 01:05:52.956
Fuck! You're all just fucking
standing there watching,

790
01:05:52.958 --> 01:05:54.522
what the fuck is wrong
with you?

791
01:05:56.125 --> 01:05:59.389
- Please! Please!
- No, fucking leave her alone!

792
01:05:59.391 --> 01:06:01.223
Please, listen to me.
Let me explain!

793
01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:02.590
What? Explain what?

794
01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:04.656
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

795
01:06:04.658 --> 01:06:06.656
Please! What you just saw

796
01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:09.757
is a long, long,
long observed custom.

797
01:06:09.759 --> 01:06:11.557
- "Custom!" It's fucked!
- Yes.

798
01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:14.025
Those two who jumped
have just reached

799
01:06:14.027 --> 01:06:16.758
the end of
their Harga life-cycle.

800
01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.524
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

801
01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:23.258
- "Joy?"
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

802
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.624
it will be a great joy for me.

803
01:06:25.626 --> 01:06:28.225
- Fuck.
- We view life as a circle,

804
01:06:28.227 --> 01:06:29.859
a recycle.

805
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:33.158
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

806
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.358
And that baby over there
who is not yet born

807
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.458
will inherit that name.

808
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.926
Instead of getting old

809
01:06:39.928 --> 01:06:43.325
and dying in pain
and fear and shame,

810
01:06:43.327 --> 01:06:45.494
we give our life.

811
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:47.560
As a gesture.

812
01:06:47.562 --> 01:06:49.994
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

813
01:06:50.562 --> 01:06:52.526
It does no good dying,

814
01:06:52.528 --> 01:06:55.027
lashing back
at the inevitable.

815
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:57.626
It corrupts the spirit.

816
01:06:57.628 --> 01:07:00.896
I'm so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

817
01:07:05.629 --> 01:07:06.963
You feeling okay?

818
01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:11.028
I just really need to not be
here right now.

819
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.030
Yeah.

820
01:07:17.429 --> 01:07:18.961
I'm gonna go.

821
01:07:18.963 --> 01:07:20.863
Just take some time
to yourself, okay.

822
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:01.000
- Hey, dude...
- Hey!

823
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.633
Holy shit, right?

824
01:08:04.567 --> 01:08:05.933
Are you okay?

825
01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:07.934
Yeah, I'm fine.

826
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.767
Good.

827
01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:17.101
Hey, listen. Um...

828
01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:19.532
I've been thinking
about something

829
01:08:19.534 --> 01:08:21.099
that I wanted to ask you.

830
01:08:21.101 --> 01:08:23.401
Or tell you, actually.

831
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:25.768
Um...

832
01:08:28.835 --> 01:08:32.233
I've been thinking
a lot about my thesis.

833
01:08:32.235 --> 01:08:34.200
And, um...

834
01:08:34.202 --> 01:08:37.535
I've decided I'm gonna
do it here. On Harga.

835
01:08:38.836 --> 01:08:40.400
And I wanted to
tell you first.

836
01:08:40.402 --> 01:08:43.969
Just so it didn't seem like
I wasn't telling you.

837
01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:49.770
I feel like... I feel like
I can't tell if you're joking.

838
01:08:54.403 --> 01:08:55.968
I mean... I mean, you know

839
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.568
I'm doing my thesis on
midsummer. That's the reason

840
01:08:58.570 --> 01:08:59.938
- why I'm here.
- Yeah.

841
01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:04.235
Yeah, but not
on this community.

842
01:09:04.237 --> 01:09:07.071
I mean, you're going
to Germany and England next.

843
01:09:08.737 --> 01:09:11.438
Well, you knew I was
gonna wanna do this.

844
01:09:13.438 --> 01:09:15.436
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

845
01:09:15.438 --> 01:09:17.368
I mean, did you even know
until just now?

846
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.603
Christian, of course you did!

847
01:09:18.605 --> 01:09:20.170
Okay, do you think
I don't know

848
01:09:20.172 --> 01:09:21.970
what you're doing?

849
01:09:21.972 --> 01:09:24.603
It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

850
01:09:24.605 --> 01:09:27.170
The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

851
01:09:27.172 --> 01:09:30.603
I'm... I'm honestly
kind of impressed.

852
01:09:30.605 --> 01:09:32.004
What the fuck, man?
What does that mean?

853
01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.469
Yeah, what the fuck!
This is what

854
01:09:33.471 --> 01:09:35.904
I've been working toward
and you know it.

855
01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:38.005
That's why you look so guilty
right now, because you know.

856
01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.537
You know
that what you're doing

857
01:09:39.539 --> 01:09:41.772
is unethical and leechy
and lazy.

858
01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:44.637
And, frankly,
it's kind of sad.

859
01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:47.172
- Fuck you!
- No, dude, not fuck me!

860
01:09:47.174 --> 01:09:48.805
Find your own subject.

861
01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:50.338
Or... Or your own passion.

862
01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.040
And, because...
All right, look.

863
01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:54.538
I am... I'm actually
invested in this.

864
01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.939
This is not some
glorified hobby

865
01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:58.341
that I'm casually
dipping my feet into.

866
01:10:05.842 --> 01:10:07.775
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

867
01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:10.207
If you're gonna
do it here too,

868
01:10:10.209 --> 01:10:12.740
I'm open to collaborating.

869
01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.308
And if not, I guess we can
both do separate theses

870
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:16.509
on the Hargas.

871
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:26.009
Dude, of all the things
to let me sleep through.

872
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.577
What?

873
01:10:32.177 --> 01:10:33.608
We're leaving
tomorrow morning.

874
01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:34.741
I know we are.

875
01:10:34.743 --> 01:10:36.441
I told Christian this already,

876
01:10:36.443 --> 01:10:38.143
and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea,

877
01:10:38.145 --> 01:10:39.976
- so if he comes up to you...
- Well, no,

878
01:10:39.978 --> 01:10:41.809
wait a minute.
I... I seriously doubt that

879
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:43.676
the elders will approve of
anything being written down.

880
01:10:43.678 --> 01:10:45.210
They're extremely protective.

881
01:10:45.212 --> 01:10:46.843
Okay, so then, I'll just use
aliases for everything.

882
01:10:46.845 --> 01:10:48.509
- Problem solved.
- Then what would be the point?

883
01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:50.009
You couldn't even get it
peer reviewed.

884
01:10:50.011 --> 01:10:52.211
And Christian did already
ask me this, by the way,

885
01:10:52.213 --> 01:10:55.176
and I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

886
01:10:55.178 --> 01:10:57.577
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

887
01:10:57.579 --> 01:10:58.909
Ah, fuck. No.

888
01:10:58.911 --> 01:11:01.211
Okay, look, uh,
I'll ask the elders.

889
01:11:01.213 --> 01:11:03.012
- Okay? Good.
- Yep.

890
01:11:14.247 --> 01:11:15.513
Dani?

891
01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.145
Um... I'm really sorry, Pelle.

892
01:11:19.147 --> 01:11:21.145
Thank you for inviting me,
but I... I really have to go.

893
01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:22.878
Can someone maybe
drive me somewhere?

894
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.544
I know I shouldn't have
let you stay for that.

895
01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:27.679
I mean, I know it looks
extreme. But we only...

896
01:11:27.681 --> 01:11:29.712
I don't know
why I'm here, Pelle!

897
01:11:29.714 --> 01:11:31.012
I don't know
why you invited us.

898
01:11:31.014 --> 01:11:32.712
I don't know.
I don't know why...

899
01:11:32.714 --> 01:11:34.313
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

900
01:11:34.315 --> 01:11:35.912
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know and I can't...

901
01:11:35.914 --> 01:11:37.745
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

902
01:11:37.747 --> 01:11:39.013
Dani, please.

903
01:11:39.015 --> 01:11:40.547
Please sit down.

904
01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:42.815
Dani.

905
01:11:45.114 --> 01:11:46.513
I invited my friends

906
01:11:46.515 --> 01:11:47.813
because this is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

907
01:11:47.815 --> 01:11:49.513
and I wanted to share it.

908
01:11:49.515 --> 01:11:52.980
Especially with my friends who
I knew would appreciate it.

909
01:11:52.982 --> 01:11:54.081
Because I...

910
01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:55.713
- I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

911
01:11:55.715 --> 01:11:57.446
Okay, but I'm not
an anthropologist

912
01:11:57.448 --> 01:11:58.781
and I don't understand
any of this.

913
01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:00.181
- Yes, yes, yes. I know.
- I don't get it.

914
01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:01.480
I know. And, and yet,

915
01:12:01.482 --> 01:12:03.881
I was the most excited
for you to come.

916
01:12:03.883 --> 01:12:07.783
Here. Here, smell this.

917
01:12:09.482 --> 01:12:10.849
What is it?

918
01:12:10.851 --> 01:12:12.748
- It calms you down.
- No, I'm fine.

919
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:14.817
I don't want it.

920
01:12:16.218 --> 01:12:17.882
- Are you sure?
- No...

921
01:12:17.884 --> 01:12:19.749
I really want to go, Pelle.
I don't... I don't want it.

922
01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:22.250
Okay.

923
01:12:22.252 --> 01:12:24.451
I know what
you're going through, Dani.

924
01:12:26.185 --> 01:12:27.950
What am I going through?

925
01:12:27.952 --> 01:12:29.616
Because I lost
my parents, too.

926
01:12:29.618 --> 01:12:31.583
- What? No, no, Pelle.
- Yes, yes, yes...

927
01:12:31.585 --> 01:12:32.950
That is not what
I'm talking about.

928
01:12:32.952 --> 01:12:34.617
I'm not talking
about my family.

929
01:12:34.619 --> 01:12:35.850
I know that's not what
you're talking about.

930
01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.217
I'm not talking
about my family...

931
01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.450
I lost my parents
when I was a little boy.

932
01:12:38.452 --> 01:12:39.883
They burned up in a fire.

933
01:12:39.885 --> 01:12:41.350
No, I wasn't talking
about that.

934
01:12:41.352 --> 01:12:44.550
My parents,
they burned up in a fire

935
01:12:44.552 --> 01:12:46.851
and I became,
technically, an orphan.

936
01:12:46.853 --> 01:12:49.751
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

937
01:12:49.753 --> 01:12:52.853
Because I do,
I really, really do.

938
01:12:54.886 --> 01:12:58.551
Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

939
01:12:58.553 --> 01:13:02.585
because I had a family here.

940
01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:06.887
Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

941
01:13:08.154 --> 01:13:10.320
And I was raised by
a community that doesn't

942
01:13:10.322 --> 01:13:14.021
bicker over what's theirs
and what's not theirs.

943
01:13:14.754 --> 01:13:16.554
That's what you were given.

944
01:13:17.288 --> 01:13:20.088
But I have always felt held.

945
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:27.554
By a family. A real family.

946
01:13:32.455 --> 01:13:34.455
Which everyone deserves.

947
01:13:36.323 --> 01:13:37.856
And you deserve.

948
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:46.387
Pelle, Christian
could walk in.

949
01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:48.389
He's what I'm talking about.

950
01:13:51.057 --> 01:13:53.557
He's my good friend
and I like him, but...

951
01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:57.357
Dani, do you feel held by him?

952
01:13:59.924 --> 01:14:02.059
Does he feel like home to you?

953
01:14:43.161 --> 01:14:45.493
Hey. How you doing?

954
01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.460
Today was tough.

955
01:14:51.427 --> 01:14:52.928
You gonna be okay?

956
01:14:55.561 --> 01:14:57.928
Are you not disturbed
by what we just saw?

957
01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.492
Yeah, of course I am.

958
01:15:01.494 --> 01:15:04.129
That was really,
really shocking.

959
01:15:05.963 --> 01:15:07.829
I'm trying to keep
an open mind though.

960
01:15:09.128 --> 01:15:11.161
That's cultural, you know?

961
01:15:11.163 --> 01:15:13.594
We stick our elders
in nursing homes.

962
01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.796
I'm sure they find
that disturbing.

963
01:15:17.197 --> 01:15:20.864
I think we really need to just
at least try to acclimate.

964
01:15:29.797 --> 01:15:31.262
Hey, do you... Sorry.

965
01:15:31.264 --> 01:15:34.096
Um, do you have
a sleeping pill I can take?

966
01:15:34.098 --> 01:15:35.163
Yeah, sure.

967
01:15:35.165 --> 01:15:36.363
Thanks.

968
01:16:02.899 --> 01:16:05.100
You're gonna wake her.

969
01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:07.779
Yo, Pelle.

970
01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.379
What'cha doin'?

971
01:19:25.813 --> 01:19:27.546
Just working in the garden.

972
01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.814
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

973
01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:36.513
Any word?

974
01:19:37.413 --> 01:19:39.045
Yeah, they said you can do it.

975
01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:41.645
As long as you absolutely
don't use any names.

976
01:19:41.647 --> 01:19:42.812
- Okay. Wow.
- Or the location

977
01:19:42.814 --> 01:19:43.980
is never even hinted at.

978
01:19:43.982 --> 01:19:45.545
- Okay.
- And you'll have to sign

979
01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:46.915
an agreement to that.

980
01:19:48.082 --> 01:19:50.213
And you're splitting it
with Christian

981
01:19:50.215 --> 01:19:52.914
because he came to me first.

982
01:19:52.916 --> 01:19:55.447
Well, that's... We'll...
We'll figure that out.

983
01:19:55.449 --> 01:19:56.680
I gotta go take a leak.

984
01:19:56.682 --> 01:19:59.380
Uh, here, can I
ask you something?

985
01:19:59.382 --> 01:20:00.546
- Yeah.
- Uh...

986
01:20:00.548 --> 01:20:03.582
Do you know what this is?

987
01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:07.248
I found it
under Christian's bed.

988
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:11.981
Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

989
01:20:11.983 --> 01:20:14.882
- A love rune. Huh.
- Yeah.

990
01:20:14.884 --> 01:20:16.950
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

991
01:20:19.516 --> 01:20:21.681
What's going on?

992
01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.448
Uh, the elders said
you can do your thesis

993
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:26.584
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

994
01:20:27.217 --> 01:20:28.382
Are you serious?

995
01:20:28.384 --> 01:20:29.882
Yeah.

996
01:20:29.884 --> 01:20:32.716
Oh, my God, thank you, man.

997
01:20:32.718 --> 01:20:34.883
That is incredible news.
Thank you.

998
01:20:34.885 --> 01:20:36.482
You're splitting it
with Josh as well.

999
01:20:36.484 --> 01:20:39.415
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

1000
01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:41.283
Okay. Well, I think my sister

1001
01:20:41.285 --> 01:20:43.152
Maja has taken
a liking to you.

1002
01:20:44.651 --> 01:20:45.919
Yeah?

1003
01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:48.383
The red head?

1004
01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:52.120
Actually, she just got
the <i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

1005
01:20:53.452 --> 01:20:56.184
It basically means that,
uh, you are...

1006
01:20:56.186 --> 01:21:00.118
You are allowed to have sex.
Pants license.

1007
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.718
- Okay. Good for her.
- Hey!

1008
01:21:08.386 --> 01:21:09.654
Hey, whoa!

1009
01:21:11.287 --> 01:21:13.253
What? Okay, relax. Relax!

1010
01:21:13.255 --> 01:21:14.918
What did I do?

1011
01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.852
- Pelle, what is going on?
- What happened? What happened?

1012
01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.888
What did I do? What did I do?

1013
01:21:25.387 --> 01:21:26.755
Dude! Okay!

1014
01:21:27.622 --> 01:21:29.586
You pissed
on the ancestral tree.

1015
01:21:29.588 --> 01:21:31.320
- The tree... So what?
- Yes, yes.

1016
01:21:31.322 --> 01:21:32.585
"So what?"

1017
01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.120
- I didn't know.
- No, it's...

1018
01:21:35.122 --> 01:21:36.753
That tree is tied
to all of our dead.

1019
01:21:36.755 --> 01:21:39.154
It's a dead tree, though.

1020
01:21:39.156 --> 01:21:40.821
- It's dead.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1021
01:21:40.823 --> 01:21:42.355
But it's important to us.

1022
01:21:42.357 --> 01:21:44.522
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

1023
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:02.889
Hey.

1024
01:22:02.891 --> 01:22:04.855
Hey. It was
really nice to meet you.

1025
01:22:04.857 --> 01:22:07.588
I'm so sorry.
We're actually leaving.

1026
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:08.923
What?

1027
01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.756
- Yeah.
- Connie.

1028
01:22:10.758 --> 01:22:12.823
Simon is getting
the truck with one of them now.

1029
01:22:12.825 --> 01:22:15.025
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

1030
01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:17.658
Connie.

1031
01:22:18.424 --> 01:22:20.090
Oh, there.

1032
01:22:20.092 --> 01:22:22.991
Uh, Simon,
he told me to tell you

1033
01:22:22.993 --> 01:22:25.624
that, uh, Jan drove him
to the train station.

1034
01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:28.156
And after, uh,
Simon gets dropped off,

1035
01:22:28.158 --> 01:22:30.924
he's sending the truck
back for you.

1036
01:22:30.926 --> 01:22:31.857
What?

1037
01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:35.091
You will meet him, uh, there.

1038
01:22:35.093 --> 01:22:36.690
No.

1039
01:22:36.692 --> 01:22:38.557
Why would he
just go without me?

1040
01:22:38.559 --> 01:22:39.958
He... He wouldn't do that.

1041
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.058
Well, the truck
only had room for two.

1042
01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.491
So...

1043
01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:47.424
What does that mean?

1044
01:22:47.426 --> 01:22:48.491
That doesn't even
make any sense.

1045
01:22:48.493 --> 01:22:49.992
He would have told me.

1046
01:22:49.994 --> 01:22:52.326
Today's only train
leaves in 90 minutes.

1047
01:22:52.328 --> 01:22:54.926
It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

1048
01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:57.126
So they didn't
want to waste time.

1049
01:22:57.128 --> 01:22:59.492
So I could have
sat on his lap.

1050
01:22:59.494 --> 01:23:01.026
Yes, I imagined that, too,

1051
01:23:01.028 --> 01:23:04.492
but, you know, we...
We don't break traffic laws.

1052
01:23:04.494 --> 01:23:05.761
Okay?

1053
01:23:08.263 --> 01:23:10.261
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

1054
01:23:10.263 --> 01:23:13.127
Now, Connie. There was
no room in the truck.

1055
01:23:13.129 --> 01:23:16.493
Yet, it is coming right back
for you. Yeah.

1056
01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:21.563
This is bullshit.

1057
01:23:31.364 --> 01:23:33.429
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1058
01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:44.962
And how are jobs
or roles assigned?

1059
01:23:44.964 --> 01:23:47.930
That's based on traits
we show as kids.

1060
01:23:47.932 --> 01:23:50.329
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi. Sorry.

1061
01:23:50.331 --> 01:23:51.698
Um...

1062
01:23:52.398 --> 01:23:54.398
Simon left without Connie.

1063
01:23:55.232 --> 01:23:57.264
- Jesus, really?
- Yeah.

1064
01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:58.732
What a dick move.

1065
01:23:59.665 --> 01:24:01.730
- Is she okay?
- Uh, no.

1066
01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:03.130
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

1067
01:24:03.132 --> 01:24:04.398
No, no.

1068
01:24:05.366 --> 01:24:06.865
That sucks.

1069
01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.498
On the... On the subject
of couples actually, um...

1070
01:24:13.633 --> 01:24:16.499
Is there ever an issue here
with incest?

1071
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.931
Sorry, I mean, you know,
small communities.

1072
01:24:21.933 --> 01:24:24.632
Well, the bloodlines
are very well-preserved.

1073
01:24:24.634 --> 01:24:28.332
So, uh, the elders
must approve mates.

1074
01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:30.832
Cousins can sometimes mate.

1075
01:24:30.834 --> 01:24:34.065
But we do respect
their incest taboo.

1076
01:24:34.067 --> 01:24:37.735
So we often need to invite
outside people.

1077
01:24:59.003 --> 01:25:01.535
Excuse me. Hey.

1078
01:25:02.502 --> 01:25:04.502
Would you like
to help join us?

1079
01:25:06.303 --> 01:25:07.570
Uh...

1080
01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:11.035
- Sure, yeah.
- Come.

1081
01:25:11.037 --> 01:25:14.002
Do you...
Do you know, um...

1082
01:25:14.004 --> 01:25:16.203
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1083
01:25:16.205 --> 01:25:18.701
Yes. He was
driven to the station.

1084
01:25:18.703 --> 01:25:20.401
Did you not say goodbye?

1085
01:25:20.403 --> 01:25:21.869
No. No, I didn't.

1086
01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:24.569
But, uh, that's okay,
that's okay.

1087
01:25:24.571 --> 01:25:26.638
Hi.

1088
01:25:31.537 --> 01:25:33.237
What are we making here?

1089
01:25:33.239 --> 01:25:34.604
Meat tarts!

1090
01:25:35.139 --> 01:25:36.837
Oh, wow.

1091
01:25:36.839 --> 01:25:38.770
Oh, thank you.

1092
01:25:40.872 --> 01:25:42.739
She said you're so beautiful.

1093
01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.437
Oh, thank you.

1094
01:25:45.439 --> 01:25:48.105
Um, she's so beautiful.

1095
01:25:51.606 --> 01:25:55.205
We describe it
like emotional sheet music.

1096
01:25:55.207 --> 01:25:56.838
Hmm. What does it say?

1097
01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.538
Well, each runic letter

1098
01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.373
stands for one
of the 16 affects,

1099
01:26:02.375 --> 01:26:06.538
which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

1100
01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:09.005
This one, for example,
is about grief.

1101
01:26:09.007 --> 01:26:10.072
Hmm.

1102
01:26:10.074 --> 01:26:12.239
You can see
at the end, however,

1103
01:26:12.241 --> 01:26:15.072
we have blank pages.

1104
01:26:15.074 --> 01:26:20.073
This is because the <i>Rubi Radr</i>
is a work forever in progress.

1105
01:26:20.075 --> 01:26:21.173
Forever evolving.

1106
01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:24.175
We have many,
many hundreds of these.

1107
01:26:25.508 --> 01:26:29.374
And who decides
what gets added?

1108
01:26:29.376 --> 01:26:34.110
Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Rubin.

1109
01:26:36.843 --> 01:26:40.341
Uh, the disabled?

1110
01:26:40.343 --> 01:26:42.507
Since birth.

1111
01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:46.510
He draws
and we, the elders, interpret.

1112
01:26:47.976 --> 01:26:49.142
You see, Josh,

1113
01:26:49.144 --> 01:26:52.541
Rubin is unclouded
by normal cognition.

1114
01:26:52.543 --> 01:26:55.942
It makes him open
for the source.

1115
01:26:55.944 --> 01:27:02.542
Uh, what happens
when Rubin dies?

1116
01:27:02.544 --> 01:27:05.543
Do you just wait
for a baby that is...

1117
01:27:07.478 --> 01:27:08.643
Not clouded?

1118
01:27:08.645 --> 01:27:10.010
No, no, no.

1119
01:27:10.012 --> 01:27:13.178
Uh, Rubin was a product
of inbreeding.

1120
01:27:14.112 --> 01:27:15.143
All of our Oracles

1121
01:27:15.145 --> 01:27:18.079
are deliberate products
of inbreeding.

1122
01:27:21.544 --> 01:27:22.913
Can I take a photograph?

1123
01:27:24.412 --> 01:27:26.111
What?

1124
01:27:26.113 --> 01:27:27.510
Uh, a photograph?

1125
01:27:27.512 --> 01:27:31.044
- No. Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

1126
01:27:31.046 --> 01:27:33.712
Absolutely not.

1127
01:27:58.481 --> 01:28:00.482
Oh, fuck, yep, that's her.

1128
01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.082
Hey.

1129
01:28:16.549 --> 01:28:18.583
Oh, great. She's walking away.

1130
01:28:39.151 --> 01:28:40.417
Thank you.

1131
01:28:47.084 --> 01:28:49.085
Thanks.

1132
01:28:49.817 --> 01:28:51.052
Thanks.

1133
01:28:57.186 --> 01:28:58.853
Has anyone seen Connie?

1134
01:29:00.886 --> 01:29:02.619
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1135
01:29:03.552 --> 01:29:04.883
I'm sure I saw her trying out

1136
01:29:04.885 --> 01:29:06.550
for the sprinting
Olympics earlier.

1137
01:29:06.552 --> 01:29:07.851
What? Where?

1138
01:29:07.853 --> 01:29:09.784
Sorry, but I can say
what happened.

1139
01:29:09.786 --> 01:29:11.219
Her boyfriend
called the landline

1140
01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:13.550
from the train station
and calmed Connie down.

1141
01:29:13.552 --> 01:29:16.419
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

1142
01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.752
Okay, well, that's a relief.

1143
01:29:21.754 --> 01:29:23.787
Why would Simon leave
without her?

1144
01:29:24.987 --> 01:29:27.122
I'm sure it was just
a miscommunication.

1145
01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:46.622
I could see you
possibly doing that.

1146
01:29:51.656 --> 01:29:53.123
What the hell does that mean?

1147
01:29:59.390 --> 01:30:00.657
Never mind.

1148
01:30:07.324 --> 01:30:10.557
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

1149
01:30:16.324 --> 01:30:18.125
Dude, is he going to kill me?

1150
01:30:20.991 --> 01:30:23.557
Did you learn anything
about the <i>Rubi Radr?</i>

1151
01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.291
Oh, so now
you wanna collaborate?

1152
01:30:31.293 --> 01:30:32.657
Okay, thank you.

1153
01:30:32.659 --> 01:30:33.790
- I know that one elder...
- Thank you.

1154
01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:35.058
...gave you a glimpse of it.

1155
01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.659
Thank you.
Sorry I brought it up.

1156
01:31:00.593 --> 01:31:03.692
Oh, my God, dude.
What the fuck?

1157
01:31:03.694 --> 01:31:05.458
- Is that...
- What is that?

1158
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.425
- Is that a fucking pube?
- Ew.

1159
01:31:07.427 --> 01:31:08.558
It's just a hair.

1160
01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.161
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1161
01:31:10.561 --> 01:31:12.426
Dude, calm down.

1162
01:31:12.428 --> 01:31:13.825
Why are you embarrassed?

1163
01:31:13.827 --> 01:31:16.560
You're not the one
giving out hair pies.

1164
01:31:36.031 --> 01:31:38.962
Jesus Christ. He's still
fucking lookin' at me.

1165
01:31:38.964 --> 01:31:41.630
Hey. You'll come with me?

1166
01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:44.597
- What?
- You'll come?

1167
01:31:45.231 --> 01:31:46.730
- Uh...
- I'll show you.

1168
01:31:47.131 --> 01:31:48.561
Okay, sure.

1169
01:31:48.563 --> 01:31:51.029
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

1170
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:52.896
Um...

1171
01:31:52.898 --> 01:31:55.097
I'll be back. I guess
she's gonna show me.

1172
01:32:18.166 --> 01:32:20.530
Hey, can I, uh,
borrow another sleeping pill?

1173
01:32:20.532 --> 01:32:22.134
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

1174
01:32:25.067 --> 01:32:26.066
Thank you.

1175
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.272
What the fuck, Mark?

1176
01:34:17.274 --> 01:34:18.939
What the fuck are you doing?
Close the door,

1177
01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:20.941
we're not supposed
to be in here.

1178
01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:20.078
Do you think Mark's
still up with that girl?

1179
01:35:21.245 --> 01:35:22.778
I wouldn't be surprised.

1180
01:35:25.779 --> 01:35:27.110
What about Josh though?

1181
01:35:27.112 --> 01:35:29.179
I'm honestly
not too concerned.

1182
01:35:30.946 --> 01:35:32.013
Wow.

1183
01:35:32.913 --> 01:35:35.044
We, um,

1184
01:35:35.046 --> 01:35:38.378
have something regretful
to announce.

1185
01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:42.145
This morning
the 19th Book of <i>Rubi Radr</i>

1186
01:35:42.147 --> 01:35:44.613
was found missing
from the Temple.

1187
01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.946
We don't want
to point fingers,

1188
01:35:48.948 --> 01:35:51.145
yet, we kindly ask
that whoever took it

1189
01:35:51.147 --> 01:35:53.478
to return it
to its original place.

1190
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.146
You can leave it
in the Temple,

1191
01:35:55.148 --> 01:35:58.112
<i>which will be left unguarded,
unwatched.</i>

1192
01:35:58.114 --> 01:36:01.115
<i>Nobody needs to know
it was you.</i>

1193
01:36:13.982 --> 01:36:15.579
Where is your friend, Josh?

1194
01:36:15.581 --> 01:36:18.816
I know. Uh, we have no idea.

1195
01:36:19.581 --> 01:36:21.847
He and your other friend,

1196
01:36:21.849 --> 01:36:24.582
they both disappears
the same day.

1197
01:36:26.183 --> 01:36:27.914
- You see how it looks?
- Yes, obviously.

1198
01:36:27.916 --> 01:36:30.048
But I swear to you
we're in the dark on this.

1199
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.051
We're just as confused
as you are.

1200
01:36:33.383 --> 01:36:35.917
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

1201
01:36:36.817 --> 01:36:38.848
- What girl?
- Inge.

1202
01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:40.615
Yeah, but Mark
wouldn't have done this.

1203
01:36:40.617 --> 01:36:42.481
Josh on the other hand,

1204
01:36:42.483 --> 01:36:43.748
he came to bed with us

1205
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:45.417
and when we woke up,
he was gone.

1206
01:36:45.419 --> 01:36:47.748
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

1207
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:50.016
we don't associate
as friends of his

1208
01:36:50.018 --> 01:36:52.082
or collaborators or anything.

1209
01:36:52.084 --> 01:36:53.849
We would just be
so embarrassed

1210
01:36:53.851 --> 01:36:56.518
to be connected to this
in any way, shape or form.

1211
01:36:58.252 --> 01:37:00.885
Let's hope it gets returned.

1212
01:37:01.518 --> 01:37:02.649
I hope so too.

1213
01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:04.684
I feel responsible.

1214
01:37:04.686 --> 01:37:07.650
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1215
01:37:07.652 --> 01:37:10.019
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1216
01:37:11.353 --> 01:37:15.251
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1217
01:37:15.253 --> 01:37:16.717
Oh, hi.

1218
01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:19.720
And, uh, Siv wants to see you
in her house.

1219
01:37:27.486 --> 01:37:29.187
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1220
01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920
Okay.

1221
01:37:32.454 --> 01:37:33.653
Okay.

1222
01:38:14.724 --> 01:38:16.121
This is the big one.

1223
01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.823
Okay. Thank you.

1224
01:38:22.691 --> 01:38:24.289
Look into her eyes.

1225
01:38:24.291 --> 01:38:25.889
Mmm-hmm.

1226
01:38:25.891 --> 01:38:29.589
Um, can I ask
what this is exactly?

1227
01:38:29.591 --> 01:38:32.857
It's, um...
Tea for the competition.

1228
01:38:38.892 --> 01:38:42.558
- And then you, glass here.
- Mmm-hmm.

1229
01:38:44.292 --> 01:38:45.292
And then we drink it.

1230
01:38:45.726 --> 01:38:47.125
- Okay?
- Okay.

1231
01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.459
Okay.

1232
01:38:53.759 --> 01:38:54.958
Mmm-hmm?

1233
01:38:56.293 --> 01:38:57.624
Uh-oh!

1234
01:38:57.626 --> 01:38:59.694
- Oh, God.
- Here we go!

1235
01:41:02.135 --> 01:41:03.568
Please. Come in.

1236
01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:58.071
First thing
I just have to say,

1237
01:41:58.073 --> 01:42:00.637
I have no idea where Josh is.

1238
01:42:00.639 --> 01:42:02.837
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1239
01:42:02.839 --> 01:42:04.839
How do you feel about Maja?

1240
01:42:09.506 --> 01:42:11.006
About Maja?

1241
01:42:16.174 --> 01:42:19.072
How do I
feel about her how?

1242
01:42:19.074 --> 01:42:22.138
You have been approved
to mate with her.

1243
01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:26.072
You're an ideal
astrological match.

1244
01:42:26.074 --> 01:42:28.807
And she has
fixed her hopes on you.

1245
01:42:35.176 --> 01:42:38.440
I think I ate
one of her pubic hairs.

1246
01:42:38.442 --> 01:42:40.208
Sounds probably right.

1247
01:43:22.145 --> 01:43:23.575
Stop!

1248
01:43:29.844 --> 01:43:31.943
Stay here.

1249
01:43:31.945 --> 01:43:33.676
Are you ready?

1250
01:43:33.678 --> 01:43:35.511
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1251
01:44:45.884 --> 01:44:47.950
Stop!

1252
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:53.383
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1253
01:44:53.385 --> 01:44:54.415
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1254
01:44:54.417 --> 01:44:55.649
Eight! Eight!

1255
01:44:55.651 --> 01:44:56.615
- There are eight left.
- What?

1256
01:45:22.019 --> 01:45:22.883
Uh...

1257
01:45:22.885 --> 01:45:24.953
- For you.
- Uh...

1258
01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:28.020
Thanks.

1259
01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.617
- What is it?
- Um...

1260
01:45:30.619 --> 01:45:32.484
It's... Sorry.

1261
01:45:33.754 --> 01:45:38.720
Spring water
with special properties.

1262
01:45:39.221 --> 01:45:40.517
Oh.

1263
01:45:40.519 --> 01:45:43.453
Okay.

1264
01:45:43.455 --> 01:45:46.020
- Okay.
- What does it do?

1265
01:45:46.022 --> 01:45:47.188
Oh, um...

1266
01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:48.986
It, uh...

1267
01:45:48.988 --> 01:45:51.653
It breaks down your defenses

1268
01:45:51.655 --> 01:45:55.587
and opens you
for the influence.

1269
01:45:56.455 --> 01:45:57.722
Okay.

1270
01:45:59.289 --> 01:46:00.788
Thanks.

1271
01:46:01.322 --> 01:46:02.823
You're welcome.

1272
01:46:03.756 --> 01:46:05.886
You know what? Um...

1273
01:46:05.888 --> 01:46:07.388
I'm worried
I'll have a bad trip.

1274
01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:10.689
Oh, no, no. You won't.
You won't. Trust me.

1275
01:47:54.263 --> 01:47:57.529
- I don't speak Swedish.
- What?

1276
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:27.599
What? What?

1277
01:48:36.433 --> 01:48:37.966
What's happening?

1278
01:48:39.933 --> 01:48:43.266
You are our May Queen.

1279
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.665
- Me?
- Yes!

1280
01:48:45.667 --> 01:48:47.201
- Why?
- You won!

1281
01:48:48.499 --> 01:48:50.165
What does that mean?

1282
01:48:50.167 --> 01:48:51.631
What? Oh.

1283
01:49:41.404 --> 01:49:43.704
Mom? Mom?

1284
01:49:45.004 --> 01:49:48.370
Oh, my God, Dani! May Queen!

1285
01:52:26.316 --> 01:52:27.316
Herring?

1286
01:52:27.748 --> 01:52:29.016
What for?

1287
01:52:30.049 --> 01:52:32.513
It's tradition. For good luck.

1288
01:52:32.515 --> 01:52:34.081
Yeah.

1289
01:52:34.083 --> 01:52:36.980
- What?
- And you must eat it whole.

1290
01:52:36.982 --> 01:52:39.647
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no!

1291
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:41.581
You must try!

1292
01:52:41.583 --> 01:52:43.582
- You must try!
- Ahhh!

1293
01:52:53.851 --> 01:52:56.081
Very good try.

1294
01:52:59.151 --> 01:53:00.516
Excuse me...

1295
01:53:01.817 --> 01:53:03.351
What's going on?

1296
01:53:11.917 --> 01:53:13.818
Why did you do that?

1297
01:53:20.718 --> 01:53:22.919
To our May Queen!

1298
01:53:26.119 --> 01:53:27.986
<i>Skal!</i>

1299
01:53:39.854 --> 01:53:41.720
You are the family now! Yes?

1300
01:53:42.321 --> 01:53:44.187
Yes, you are the family.

1301
01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:45.920
Like sisters.

1302
01:54:58.625 --> 01:55:01.857
Your dance was amazing.

1303
01:55:01.859 --> 01:55:04.526
I've never seen someone
dance like that.

1304
01:55:17.727 --> 01:55:20.292
Now, it's traditional
for the May Queen

1305
01:55:20.294 --> 01:55:23.194
to bless our crops
and livestock.

1306
01:55:24.627 --> 01:55:26.959
And after the luck
you just inherited

1307
01:55:26.961 --> 01:55:28.625
from that salt herring,

1308
01:55:28.627 --> 01:55:31.326
we should all be
doubly encouraged.

1309
01:55:44.728 --> 01:55:46.528
Can Christian
come with me?

1310
01:55:47.295 --> 01:55:48.527
Nay.

1311
01:55:48.529 --> 01:55:50.228
The Queen must ride alone.

1312
01:58:25.306 --> 01:58:26.839
Repeat after me.

1313
01:59:13.243 --> 01:59:14.610
Breathe in.

1314
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:19.177
For your vitality.

1315
02:03:43.128 --> 02:03:45.162
We shall go now
to Siv's house.

1316
02:03:45.694 --> 02:03:47.093
What's this?

1317
02:03:47.095 --> 02:03:49.994
It is a special meeting,
only for the Queens.

1318
02:03:49.996 --> 02:03:51.592
And she will bless you.

1319
02:03:55.363 --> 02:03:56.560
What's that?

1320
02:03:56.562 --> 02:03:58.096
That's not for us.

1321
02:04:03.695 --> 02:04:05.064
I think you should not.

1322
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:56.235
No, no, no.

1323
02:10:47.324 --> 02:10:48.690
Christian?

1324
02:10:49.523 --> 02:10:51.291
Christian.

1325
02:10:54.357 --> 02:10:55.623
Hi.

1326
02:10:56.958 --> 02:10:59.258
Hello, there you are.

1327
02:10:59.591 --> 02:11:01.090
Listen.

1328
02:11:01.092 --> 02:11:04.559
You can't speak.
You can't move.

1329
02:11:05.392 --> 02:11:06.758
All right?

1330
02:11:07.459 --> 02:11:08.889
Good.

1331
02:11:18.992 --> 02:11:24.158
On this, the day
of our deity of reciprocity,

1332
02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:27.658
we gather
to give special thanks

1333
02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:29.791
to our treasured sun.

1334
02:11:29.793 --> 02:11:32.258
As an offering to our father,

1335
02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:36.927
we will today surrender
nine human lives.

1336
02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.392
As Harga takes,
so Harga also gives.

1337
02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:47.193
Thus, for every
new blood sacrificed,

1338
02:11:47.195 --> 02:11:50.928
we will dedicate
one of our own.

1339
02:11:51.828 --> 02:11:55.096
That is four new bloods.

1340
02:11:55.694 --> 02:11:57.195
Four from Harga.

1341
02:11:58.161 --> 02:12:01.693
And one to be chosen
by the Queen.

1342
02:12:01.695 --> 02:12:04.960
Nine in all to die

1343
02:12:04.962 --> 02:12:09.527
and be reborn
in the great cycle.

1344
02:12:09.529 --> 02:12:13.594
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1345
02:12:13.596 --> 02:12:18.796
As for our end, we have two
already dedicated

1346
02:12:21.729 --> 02:12:24.863
and two who have volunteered.

1347
02:12:25.729 --> 02:12:28.098
Ingemar and Ulf.

1348
02:12:31.264 --> 02:12:34.098
You have brought
outside offerings.

1349
02:12:34.997 --> 02:12:39.029
Plus volunteering
your own bodies.

1350
02:12:39.031 --> 02:12:43.465
You will today be joined
in harmony with everything.

1351
02:12:44.466 --> 02:12:48.896
And to Pelle,
who has brought new blood

1352
02:12:48.898 --> 02:12:51.163
and our new May Queen,

1353
02:12:51.165 --> 02:12:56.497
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1354
02:12:56.499 --> 02:13:01.231
And so,
for our ninth offering,

1355
02:13:01.233 --> 02:13:04.765
it is traditional that
our fair Queen shall choose

1356
02:13:04.767 --> 02:13:07.098
between a preselected
new blood

1357
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:10.766
and a specially-ordained
Hargan.

1358
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:38.202
Turbeyon.

1359
02:13:39.102 --> 02:13:42.735
Honorable Turbeyon!
Please step forward.

1360
02:13:47.269 --> 02:13:48.336
And...

1361
02:14:06.903 --> 02:14:09.104
Christian Hughes.

1362
02:14:11.904 --> 02:14:13.735
These are the candidates

1363
02:14:13.737 --> 02:14:16.138
for the ninth
and final offering.

1364
02:14:17.704 --> 02:14:20.805
We patiently await
your verdict.
